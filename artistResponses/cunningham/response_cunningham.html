<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Being at home has led me to focus on watercolors as they are easier to set up and tear down to in my home with up to 5 people living	there.  I've created some new work during this time while learning more basics of internet connections which I'll need in the fall when school starts.  My work has been changed by both the virus and the social unrest as we head into the elections.  I'm finding little successes that help me through the weeks.</p>
