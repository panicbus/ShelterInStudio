<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>At first I felt overwhelmed by the suffering, death and fear brought on by COVID all over the world. All I wanted to do was plant seeds in my garden and watch  little shoots come up, grow vegetables from kitchen scraps, etc.</p>
    
    <p>I wanted to reconnect with people who've been important to me throughout my life. It felt like a phase of life was ending, and a more conscious one was beginning- less busy and complex, more focused on what most mattered.</p>
    
    <p>It took a while to get back to painting- I'd had shoulder surgery in the winter and hadn't painted for months. I was finally healed by April but it felt like an impossible hurdle to get started again . One day my husband took my hand and led me to my easel, saying- "there's cobwebs in your studio, I'm worried about you!" and I just began painting again. It was kind of a relief to finally get back to it. Painting also energized me to get involved in social action projects around BLM, and Reclaim Our Vote.</p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>I have been painting pretty steadily. Partly it was the pressure of knowing the  galleries I'm in would be asking for new work soon. The pressure was helpful as a motivator.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>I'm a plein air landscape painter and my goal has always been to create a sense of luminosity in my work. Lately I've been really drawn to painting nocturnes, and also underwater spaces that are empty except for some light glittering above on the surface, both clearly coming from the feeling of these past months.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>I'm used to a cycle of painting intensely for shows, then having big friendly receptions and lots of interactions with people around the show, then I rest for a while, then start painting intensely again for the next show.</p>
    
    <p>Just painting without knowing when I'll have a show again feels strange. Also, I'm stimulated to paint by seeing different natural places, so spending most of my time inside has limited that. Iâ€˜ve started painting more from memory - my underwater painting was a memory of swimming in the Yuba River, watching the wavy light patterns on the rocks below.</p> 
    
    <p>All in all though, I'm actually enjoying the quiet unpressured time to just explore, learn and paint.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>I'm enjoying painting different kinds of light than I used to, it's feels good to struggle and have the learning curve get steeper. Also I've been getting good responses and interest in my work lately, and recently found out I was accepted into the deYoung Open show which I'm excited about.</p>
