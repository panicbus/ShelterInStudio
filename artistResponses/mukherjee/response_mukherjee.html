<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>I feel so much longing for spatial and tactile dimensions - it has made me realize something essential about myself and about the physicality of my work. I had to leave a residency when the orders came down. I had shot some video there, but have not touched it since because I don’t want to be on a screen longer than I need to right now.</p>
    <p>At the very beginning I worked in a corner of my living room, moving between small watercolor drawings, reading and writing. I worked in short bursts punctuated by helping my 13 year olds get accustomed to school at home, and hearing dimensions of their lives that I am normally not exposed to. After a month of quarantine, I was able to go back to my studio where I work alone, to work on larger paintings.</p>
    <p>I have also been in touch with people I have not seen in a long time and found myself working with them on projects. I have been having intense conversations that feed into my work.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>Yes- I’ve made some new drawings and paintings, a very short video about visioning a different future and an online exhibition.</p>
    <p>I’ve also been developing ideas, writing proposals/applications and doing more exploratory writing for myself.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>I think so but its hard to say exactly how just yet- I’d say” this period” is still happening.</p>
    <p>Prior to the arrival of Covid, I had started fundraising and development on a video/performance project called ‘Ensemble for Non-Linear Time’ that uses speculative fiction to explore experiences of rupture in ways that expand agency and imaginative capacity.  I am proposing to do this work with dancers and a community cast.  My experiences of rupture during this time, due to personal circumstances, the collective impacts of covid19 and the uprisings for racial justice, leads me to understand the spirit of this work in new ways.</p>
    <p>In my more private studio work/painting practice, I became interested in making a type of ‘still life’ which is a surprising place to find myself. I need to embody the longing I feel, the sense of living in suspended animation, the lack of certainty for the foreseeable future. I think I am am also responding to a range of conditions; from spending so much time at home and seeing people through screens in their homes, to mortality being front and center every day and the fear of infection that interrupts touch.</p>
    <p>There is something beautiful that lives alongside the discomfort.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>There are material things- I have not been able to do the printing I had planned or attend scheduled residencies. My studio mate had to move out and that left me paying more rent than I can afford, so I’m moving studio. But these feel very minor in the grand scheme of things.</p>
    <p>All the emotions - fear, worry, uncertainty, grief, anger, being politically at wits end. Too much time with social media but feeling a need to stay present. Trying to find ways to engage and act without putting people in my home or elsewhere at risk.  I’ve felt worried for the kids, and also so proud of them.</p>
    <p>And the longing, so much of it.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>I’m not sure I know yet what will unfold as successful - but the elongated timelines of postponed residencies and exhibitions feels in some ways like a luxury. The weirdness of now makes it clear to me how my work connects to my sense of survival (personal and collective), as well as desire and the essential role of visionary tools. I am not doing entirely different things, but I feel and understand what I am doing differently - out beyond the labels we give it, and perhaps more deeply — which I think is a kind of success.</p>
    <p>I have  connected with some old and new friends in ways that feel very important, in terms of generating ways to move forward and make better futures.</p>
