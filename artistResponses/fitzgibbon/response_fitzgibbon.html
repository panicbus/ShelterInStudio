<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I've been productive in small ways by completing projects started as teaching demos for my two ceramic classes at Cosumnes River College: Beginning Wheel Thrown Ceramics and Clay Sculpture. Midway through the semester, my classes were canceled, as well as the summer clay sculpture class. Being 100% online in the Fall, I was only offered a General Sculpture class. They've eliminated all ceramic offerings. It felt like the rug was pulled out from underneath me, particularly because I restructured my classes to run online for the rest of spring and felt confident that I could provide a challenging curriculum: yes, different from expectations, but enriched nonetheless. The lack of support from administration has been gut punch. I mourn the fact that the support is nonexistent for ceramics in particular, and that the arts in general have had to bear the brunt of cuts. Is there a future for ceramic programing at this institution?</p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Now that the smaller works started during the semester are complete, I have been able to finish two large pieces created during an artist residency last summer (mainly refinement of plaster). My goal is to continue to develop these mixed media works once I have finished organizing and cleaning my studio. I crave a white wall to suspend large drawings from and clear my head and studio of the clutter. I am grateful for the flexibility of time the pandemic has afforded. Looming will be the need to develop my online Fall class. For now, I am going to try to take care of myself.</p>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Yes, most definitely my work has been more about completing loose ends rather than committing to breaking ground for new work. I'll get there, hopefully soon, but a nesting instinct has kicked in before I can begin afresh. There is a lingering feeling of futility and personal insignificance that is most trying. Perhaps it is my way of dealing with all of the loss around us and thoughts on the transience of life. There are so many big battles to fight it is overwhelming. I've also been more politically charged, attending rallies and addressing local politicians to try to make a positive difference. </p>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>How can one mourn and be one of the lucky ones (no illness, wonderful family – though all on the east coast, enough funds to weather the downturn)? But never have I felt so inconsequential, insignificant, and disposable. I'm making all this stuff that has weight and takes up space where as the world is favoring the lightning speed of ethernet over the tangible human touch. This has been the biggest challenge of my life because at 62, I don't feel resilient to redefirect my passions for teaching and making. Spending hours in front of a screen makes me feel unhealthy. That is why I turned to clay after a ten year career in book/graphic design out of college. </p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I haven't felt stuck at home because I am surrounded by a bountiful yard, with colorful blooming flowers and plants that I've nurtured after pulling up the grass three years ago. Since March, I have instinctively sought wonder and pleasure in the landscape both by planting more edible and flowering plants, and also by creating flavorful dishes and desserts to share with my "husband" of 20+ years. It must be a nesting, burrowing instinct. His life has hardly changed except that he is back to a daily 25 mile bike ride. Otherwise, his nose is to the creation and repair of bowed stringed instruments. </p>
