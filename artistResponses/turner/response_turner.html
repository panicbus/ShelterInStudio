<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>All museum staff have been on "OOO" status, our calendar shorthand  for "Out of Office", since mid-March. During the past decade my art practice has evolved under the influence of Object Oriented Ontology, so I appreciate the irony of the shared abbreviation when I consider recent production in quarantine.  Under reductive biological categorization,  a "non-human"  factor, COVID-19 virus, has shifted the social, political, and ecological context of art production and exhibition making. New conditions are inconvenient, but generative as well. I was very sick for a month, as the virus passed through, but my art production has adapted to consider exhibitions without viewers, and exhibitions for non-humans. OOO is an area that I was already at work on, but the progression is accelerated.</p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I created one piece that I installed in my home for six weeks. Nobody other than my immediate family saw it;  Keys That Fit (2020). During this period I have also constructed a quarter-pipe skateboard ramp in the driveway, a pig pen, a large redwood garden bed, a smaller herb bed, a backyard archery range, custom designed and shaped four skateboard decks, and built out a sleeping loft to convert our van to a family camper. I collaborated on a short video with artists Stephen Kaltenbach and Justin Marsh.</p>

	<p>Yes</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Murray Bowles: Sixteen Frames, an exhibition that I co-curated at Axis Gallery in Sacramento, was closed one week after the opening reception. It was recently deinstalled.</p>
	<p>The virus joined my body at the end of April, I felt like I might die, and I was in bed for nearly all of May.
	<p>Police murders of Black people.</p>
	<p>Wildly destructive forest fires in California.</p>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I am still alive and thinking.</p>
