<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">I have my printer in my home studio/office, so am able to continue to work while stuck at home.  I am spending even more time than usual in front of a screen, and am sharing my space with both my husband and daughter.  I use my daily walks as a time to get away from screens and be by myself, in addition to getting some exercise, so it seemed a perfect time to make art too.</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">Yes.  I definitely felt that I needed to make work, and wanted to have a daily ritual.  I decided at the start of shelter in place to photograph during my daily walks.  My art is about noticing things, and about beauty, which I brought to this current project.  Each day I photograph what catches my eye as beautiful and then I post it to Instagram the following morning.  I decided early on to make this project a fundraiser for five organizations responding to COVID-19: SF-Marin Food Bank, Meals on Wheels, ACLU, Tipping Point and Safety Net Fund for Bay Area Artists. I feel fortunate that both my husband and I still have our jobs and income, and I wanted to do something to give back to the larger community.  For a $50 donation of more, donors can get an 8.5x11" print from this series.</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">I feel that it has freed me up, and brought me back to my pure love of photography.  Also, I was already thinking in terms of creating work that was site specific, and this project by it’s nature is limited to my neighborhood - about a 20 block radius.  I also am loving having a daily practice - that is something I want to keep even after the shelter in place order is lifted.  I’m also enjoying the challenges of finding new images each day. It’s very spontaneous and immediate.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">Time (as always).  I’m still teaching, and moving my classes online was more time consuming in some ways than teaching in person.</div> 

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">I have found this to be a generative time for me.  I have made lots of photographs, and so far have raised over $1200 with my fundraiser.  I feel like the art world is being more inclusive and open, which is exciting.  These photos have been in an online exhibition with Borderline Arts Collective, included in an online publication - Quaranzine - and in an online exhibition called Lazy Susan 2 with Blue Arrangements.  I was also inspired by many other photographers (and artists) that I know who were making new work as a result of the shelter in place order.  In some cases they needed to change their way of making work, in others they changed their subject matter.  I saw so much great art on my Instagram feed, that as a curator I felt it would make an interesting exhibition. SF Camerawork features lens-based projects I selected on their Instagram  and website in a series called Quarantine Picture Show, and I will be moderating two dates of artists interviews from this series for them in the upcoming weeks.</div>
