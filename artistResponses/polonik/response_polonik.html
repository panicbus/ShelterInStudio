<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
  <p>I was lucky that I just had moved into a shared art space. Even though we had to keep socially distanced,  I got the chance to work at the studio for about four hours a day. I worried and thought a lot about disasters and traumas and how to cope with all the unknowns and doubts. At the same time the  studio turned into a sanctuary where I could listen better to my 'inner voice'.</p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
 <p>I had used very small 'cards' (2,5"x3,5") for work with material from nature, pigments, wax and all kinds of mixed media before. But this format felt especially right at the moment, expressing a little prayer or a meditative mood.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>I rather wanted to draw with nature instead from nature. Thinking of Brice Marden's work I started drawing with sticks and twigs on heavy cotton paper  - using inks and rubbing in cold wax and pigments. I wanted to come closer to my own nature. For a longer time I am interested in pigments but now I wish even more to make own paint materials from the scratch.</p>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Working against frustration and feelings of meaninglessness, reminding myself that we always have to work with our conditions and circumstances even if we want to change them. And I tried to focus on what feels essential.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Just to keep going, continuing to work, moving on, believing in what comes next, hoping that we get closer in realizing how connected everything is.</p>
