<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>It did in the beginning. It was difficult to concentrate but I still continued to go into my studio. Even just sitting and staring makes me feel more grounded.</p>
 </div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>Yes my work has not been impacted. In fact it feels like I am making even more work. I feel even more cognizant of time and how it's such a precious commodity.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>No.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p> I miss seeing my other artists friends - for coffee or having them over for a visit to chat about my work or their work. </p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>I feel grateful that my studio is in my house and I can just get out of bed, in my pajamas, walk into my studio and start to work. I also live with my best friend/husband and he is also an artist. So we have been able to continue to support each other.</p>
