<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>To be perfectly honest, my art practice before the pandemic had become spotty. Most of my creative energies were split between co-running an art space with friend and fellow artist, Jen Merrill and my day job contracting as a lead preparator at an arts institution in Napa as well as hustling for on-call work with different Bay Area art handling companies. I spent many hours in the car as well as on site, which left me little in the way of energy and time for my own practice. The one bright spot has been co-running the space with my friend. The pandemic gave me a chance to re-evaluate how I've structured the other part of my life, or more to the point, how I haven't structured it. Schlepping day in and day out was not the plan, but then again I didn't really have a plan. Actively choosing art and gathering the gumption to truly make it the central axis of my life has been the big change for me; getting my head screwed back on straight about my priorities and values.</p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I've been slowly getting back to it. Just as the pandemic started my mom passed away. I've spent time since mid-March processing that, but I have started some things in the studio. I've also identified some ways I might be able to use some aspects of my practice in a commercial venture. I'm now actively taking steps to create and launch a side business that hopefully will augment my income and creatively compliment my studio practice. I'm in the building steam phase for that part. </p>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>In small ways it's continued to evolve. The biggest change has been an evolving clarity about the paintings I've been doing since 2013. I made a big switch in direction at that time, returning to sculpture, and almost from the start the decision process for how I go about making the sculptures was pretty clear. It was how the switcheroo impacted my 2D work that's been harder to understand. The mental free space the pandemic has opened up has allowed me to see more clearly where that work is headed.</p>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>One of my big challenges is that I have almost too many things started. Keeping it all on track, time management. Especially trying to develop and start a creative commercial venture in tandem with the studio work. I'm used to working efficiently to meet insane external demands thrown at me by other people, it's harder to focus and make it all hum like clockwork when it's just yourself.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Getting back up when I fall down. Adopting the concept of beginner's mind really helps!</p>
