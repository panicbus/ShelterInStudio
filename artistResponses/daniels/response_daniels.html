<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
  <p>I haven't been "stuck at home" per se. I have a small shop/studio that I rent that allows me the space to work and not be confined necessarily. So much of my work is done on my own that I didn't have to stay at home too much.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I haven't created new work really, but have had the time to revisit old projects and focus on myself and my health more. </p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>As I said in the last question, I've been revisiting old work. A lot of my current and recent work really puts focus on my work as a tradesperson and am heavily influenced by the working class, and the tools and materials that are experienced in the common persons life. One way I feel I've been doing this is by returning to an old project car that I've had for about 13 years. I did a lot of the main work to it in a high school auto shop class and as of recently, with isolation and free time through lack of work and collecting unemployment with a little government bonus, I've had the time and some funding to put some work into it. I think as an artist, I've been looking for a way to call it (the car) an art piece, or part of a practice. In some ways I'm in the "Damián Ortega" portion of this build where I have the engine completely disassembled to rebuild it due to finding metal chunks in the oil pan.</p>
	<p>As I work on it, I've been listening to "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" by Robert M. Pirsig. I'm appreciating the metaphysical qualities of diving into a machine that had other people working on it before. From a group of people in a factory to the person who worked on it as a project before me to myself and the things I did 10+ years ago as a teenager, just learning about machines. Getting lost in time while cleaning the road Gunk off of a 60 year old engine is a trip. </p>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I have some mental health struggles and the complete lack of socializing has been rough and at times have felt very alone even with a partner and a dog companion. But solitude brings about some benefits like in where my mind and work is going I believe.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I quit drinking right before my 28th birthday on March 1st. So I think that I'm pretty stoked about that. The solitude and confinement and stress of the world was a difficult place to be but I'm glad I got and remained sober throughout it. I feel like I've been thriving in this chaotic time-space.</p>
