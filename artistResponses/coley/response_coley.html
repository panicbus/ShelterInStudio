<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">My studio closed at the start of Covid-19. Luckily I was able to sometimes make work out of my teaching studio nearby. I am not working the long days( 7-10 hours) I am used to because I am not mentally able to at this time. I have set up a makeshift studio in my backyard.  My attention span has been greatly affected by the pandemic, I get tired at around 5 and need to rest and call it a day. </div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>In my practice, I am always making new work as experimentation is part of my process.</p>
<p>I took an online workshop with Giselle Hicks to learn more about coil building. Coil building is the meditative process of pinching clay to build up, you can spend hours pinching, I find soothing repetition to be a very useful technique during this hard time. To alleviate anxiety I have started pinching large shallow bowls which I find very calming.</p></div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">When you work in an unpredictable medium like clay, there are a lot failures. I have started to look at these failures and explore how to appreciate them. What are they telling me when I stop looking for perfection.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer"> 
<p>A big challenge has been imagining what the future will look like and how that is affecting my daily life. Before I always was working towards a goal, now I have less things to look forward to. I am fortunate to have my partner working from home but we are not sure how long this will last. So much is unknown.</p>
<p>Another big challenge has been seeing the effects of this virus on my community. Every person I see has a scared stricken look that gives their face a sallow palor. I am  seeing people's health effected by sadness and it makes me sad. I see the same effects in the mirror.</p></div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">I have seen success in this new climate selling work online, getting accepted into online group sales. I feel that every day I don't cry is a successful day.</div>
