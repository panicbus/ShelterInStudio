<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>In these months "sheltering in place," the practice of making art became a kind of a "tent," for me; it's been my refuge, through this time of precarity.</p>

	<p>The "tent" is fragile; fear is the antithesis of creative flow, and I have my share of fear these days… I'm afraid for those with no capacity to "shelter:" the dispossessed, the priced-out, all those inhabiting the tent cities on the street where I live, and throughout this boarded-up city. All the prior problems of San Francisco are more starkly exposed than ever in this pandemic. There is so much systemic change needed, it can feel overwhelming.</p>

	<p>The task for me as for so many has been to continue working despite so much cancelled and on hold. I had three shows scheduled for this spring and summer, and two are postponed due to covid-closures. Continuing to work feels like a magical performance, one requiring a suspension of disbelief: if I keep creating as though the world will come back... will it come back? Can we will it to come back?  I also fear "the world coming back." I'm afraid there will be an undertow pulling us to return to that strange culture dubbed "normal life." I don't believe that we can…  And what will it mean to work as an artist, with so much of the context potentially in question? </p>

	<p>I admit that through it all, I've been reveling in the silent city, waking up to (actual/imagined) urban-coyote-calls-before-dawn. And I've been thanking my lucky stars for my interior worlds: for my art practice.</p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I've been developing new elements of a very long-term project, a multi-media installation. One four-month exhibition is still scheduled to open in September, at a Native American museum in Washington State, and preparing a new incarnation of the work for that show sustains me.</p>

	<p>I'm finessing the design for a floor-to-ceiling photo-collage, to assemble with the community on-site/in the gallery. I've been working collaboratively with Bay Area artist Stacey Goodman on a set of animations for a sequential floor-projection. Remote-collaboration has its challenges, but I love what we are creating together. And I have one new project, a bridge to next possibilities, just beginning. It celebrates migration and bodies-in-motion, so it promises to be an antidote to the stay-in-place, restricted mode-of-the-moment.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I'm not sure yet if the work itself has changed; it's such a long-term project, it's hard to tell that so soon. The work is political, it deals with the nuclear predicament, that out-of-scale monster looming out of the frame; it deals with history through people's collected narratives. In this isolation, there definitely is a heightened sense of connectivity I feel, through this work.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I've been calling this time "Shattering In Place," and the image in my mind's eye is a fractured windshield: the car, yesterday's sine qua non... the shattered shield still suspended, shards tenuously hanging in place and waiting to tumble... What will hold, and what will fall apart into pieces?</p>

	<p>So how to keep balance, in the suspense of this time? Some days there's a sense of liberation and focus, but some days, it has been truly hard to proceed.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Finding all of my self-reliance: can we consider that one kind of success?</p>

	<p>The best thing during this time was being invited to submit a book proposal and finalizing that contract. I'll be making a monograph for publication in 2021 from this project that developed over several years. I'm just very thankful, in these times of tenuousness, to have that prospect ahead.</p>
