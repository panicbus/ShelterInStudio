<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>My situation is a little different than most artists as a week before shelter- in-place began I broke my hip and required a full right hip replacement. A day after I was discharged from the hospital the pandemic officially began. I didn't think too much about doing artwork as I focused for the first month on recovering from the surgery and pneumonia I acquired in the hospital.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>After a month away from painting I was overjoyed to be able to navigate the steps down to my home studio and take a look around. I was thrilled to start doing artwork again (a little at a time) and I felt great that I could walk outside again without a walker. My appreciation and gratitude for life magnified and that has continued during the pandemic. I've developed an increased awareness of the fragility and preciousness of human life.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>During this lockdown period I've spent more time in my studio doing artwork and discovered that doing art is what I need to maintain my emotional and psychological health. I've limited my intake of news and sought ways to discover joy which doesn't depend on external circumstances. Doing art is one of those ways (being out in nature, meditation and music are other ways for me). These are difficult times we live in. I've tried to use the time to discover new hope. For example, just waking up healthy and able to walk again is a good day for me! I notice more of what's around me and appreciate it-- the sun shining, the open space near my house, flowers blooming, the kindness of so many selfless people who are helping out during this time.</p>

	<p>I feel best when my days are structured. As a result of spending more time in my studio on a regular basis I have created more artwork! Since many people are experiencing mood changes during the pandemic and lockdown, I decided to explore this in my artwork. I've developed a series of mixed media artwork entitled “Mood Swing”. To date, there are eight in the series and more to come. Instead of thinking out the work in advance as I have often done previously, I'm approaching it from a feeling place, looser, more spontaneous, dependent on my emotions at the time.</p>
	
	<p>Besides working on this series, I've decided to spend the shelter-in-place time exploring new art ideas and trying different things. This has given me an increased sense of freedom. Part of my “trying new things” involves taking on-line art classes from well-established artists whose work I like.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Some of the challenges I have faced during this period, like so many others, were not being able to connect with family and friends in person. Fortunately we have come up with a creative way to meet in backyards and parks keeping social distance. I'm especially happy to be able to see my son and two year old grandson again in their backyard minus the hugs and kisses.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>The pandemic is still far from over and it's hard to measure my successes at this point. Staying alive and well is a success! I've achieved that so far! Seeing my artwork change as time goes by and not knowing how it will develop next is a success. It means the work is fresh and has some element of surprise in it. I'm excited about doing art and look forward to going into the studio regularly. This shelter-in-place period has given me the opportunity to relax more. As I get used to my new lifestyle of staying home in the studio I find myself getting more playful with paints and collage.</p>
