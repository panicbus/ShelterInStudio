<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">I feel very lucky that my practice is multi-disciplinary; I am able to shift my focus in order to meet space requirements. While at home I have been embroidering, and occasionally making small gouache paintings. I lost both of my jobs at the start of the pandemic, so I’ve started to make commissioned work as well. I've always been someone with hyper focus (making one piece at a time), but in order to give myself more of a schedule I'm splitting up my day between multiple projects. That has been the toughest aspect of the transition for me.</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
  <p>I’ve produced a surprisingly large amount of work so far. The commissions are embroidered patches based on images from art history. I seriously started embroidering about a year ago, so there is still a lot for me to learn about my relationship to the techniques. I’m making about 3 patches a week, so this project has been a good means for me to quickly improve and extend my skills in the medium. Also, it’s always a pleasure to return to art history.</p>
  <p>In my own practice, I've been doing a lot of research into psychoanalysis and finishing up a new body of work. I’ve been working on a series of embroidered tapestries called "Once There Was, Once There Wasn't", focusing on the labor of healing mechanisms and the persistence of trauma. I'm looking forward to seeing all the work together, but also to start the next endeavor—-I feel new ideas bubbling. </p>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">Aesthetically, I don't think there have been any major changes. However, since I am so close to concluding this series I’ve been doing quite a bit of writing and reflection. I want to make sure that the way I tie everything together tells an interesting story overall. I haven't had time to spend with my nose in books since grad school, so it's been clarifying to return to text and I feel revitalized in my conceptual goals.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">As I mentioned earlier, balancing my time between my projects has been the most difficult part of my at home studio practice. Time is acting so funny right now, simultaneously like molasses and oil—sticky, slow, and fast. The endless hours of reality television I consume while embroidering don't add any clarity to my sense of time either. I've been testing out different schedules but haven't found the right fit yet. It's certainly frustrating feeling like I'm spending time working on how to work, but I am confident the time I'm putting in will pay off.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">I think I have had many successes. Most significantly that I feel like I'm finally starting to wrap my head around Lacanian theory, and that I've continued to make work.</div>
