<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>Being a parent to young kids, I have been unable to find the usual quiet art-making time. So I decided to move into one of our bedrooms and create a studio space. I allowed only the materials I needed to create new work in there. A sort of minimalist temple to art making. The forced quarantine carved out a space for reflection and creation. Things that were hard to come by with the social pressures and engagements of the world we left behind. I am grateful for the time. </p></div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>Yes. I was committed to a show this summer, so I got to work within a few weeks of adjusting to the shelter in place ordinance.</p></div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>I'm a slow and cautious artist. But this time around, my work was created in a frantic pace, with a burst of creative energy - as though I was trying to capture each moment before before it slipped though my fingers, while being chased by the demons of uncertainty. I was trying to capture every color and story onto my canvases. </p></div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>My palette was unfiltered and raw. I couldn't bring my self to use my usual restraint. Once I finished the pieces for my show, I have been unable to work anymore. I have a blank canvas waiting there for me now. It has been weeks. I feel as though I'm now mourning for the life that once was.</p></div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>I worked without fear of judgement. I worked fast and furious. I worked because an inner voice told me that's how I would tell my story. And that I couldn't stop. For the sake of my sanity. It was an escape that was sweet and glorious for as long as it lasted.</p></div>
