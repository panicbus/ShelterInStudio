<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div> 
<div class="answer">I am fortunate in that my art studio is at my home - the biggest change is that now I am never alone in my house. Pre quarantine, I had arranged my schedule with days where I taught art and days where I made art. And now my schedule is weird and irregular and very much dependent on my daughter and partner being home with me all the time. I spend a lot of time homeschooling and making meals and clearing up.</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>It took me about 3 - 4 weeks into the quarantine to figure out how to make art and if I even wanted to make art. But now I am making small and quick art.</p> 
<p>I had two large commissions that came in at the end of January; I finished one in February but I had to ask for an extension from the buyer for the second. I’m finally getting going on it.</p> </div>
 
<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>My colors have shifted and are intense and brighter than before. I keep using a deep yellow / orange color in my work.</p> 
<p>In early 2020, I had joined forces with an artist in North Carolina on a cool social practice collage project called The Collage Stop (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecollagestop/?hl=en" target="_blank">@TheCollageStop</a>). Meredith had solicited paper scrap donations from two collage artists - myself and Holly Cahill in Chicago. We sent our scraps to Meredith who then led a community collage making project in North Carolina. Meredith did a brilliant job facilitating the workshop and reported that there was something really magical for participants to work with our art materials; a lot of cool conversations happened around this project and we were ready to do more. I had the second event scheduled for Richmond in April. Meredith had sent me two bags of scraps just as shelter in place orders were being established. One bag was from Holly (an artist I’ve never met) and one bag was from Meredith (an artist I’ve met once). Opening these bags up and finding the marks, colors, and gestures left by other artists on these papers was the biggest gift. I also had received a set of papers from another artist I’ve never met in Brooklyn, who had sent me scraps from her sketchbooks. And my students had given me scraps they were done with after our last class together in March. I’ve been making a bunch of new work using these gifted and collected papers. I’m using all these bits and pieces from other artists during this time and it feels really good - like a conversation in color, and from a distance. </p></div>
 
<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">I’ve always been good at reinvention and seeing new possibilities. But this is a lot of reinvention. Somedays I am just exhausted. I am not in the studio as much as I used to be. I wonder when we will ever be able to look at art in person, in groups, again. Those first few days and weeks there was so much loss. My spring and summer exhibitions were cancelled. The gallery that represents me closed its doors. I lost all my art teaching jobs and most of my income. Slowly and bit by bit, some teaching opportunities have returned and I’m offering online classes, meeting with students one on one, and making video lessons for kids. It’s not the same at all. I miss teaching and my students and making art in community. I worry about the art centers and galleries and who will be able to survive this.</div>  
 
<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">I am really excited about the super bright art I’m making. When I do have time to get into my studio (literally just sitting down in the room at the end of the house by the back door) I can get something started and then keeping puttering and working on it slowly for days. I like having a piece in progress. I also started making and selling collage kits on my website. I put together a bunch of color sorted painted and found papers, a ready to go art making session.  I’ve mailed them all over the country and sold 30 kits in 2 weeks. I really hope the folks buying these kits feel like they are part of an art making conversation with me.</div>
