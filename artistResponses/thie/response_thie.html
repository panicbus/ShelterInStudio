<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Besides being depressed by all the unfortunate who have died and been thrown out of work, my art practice has been steady and actually increased since Covid lockdown. My practice process continues with readings in microbiology and observation of nature and then making ink drops paintings and 3D model renderings inspired from the paintings.</p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Yes, some new work has come out of experimenting in my journal with drawn "puppets" integrated into works using layers of Yupo, paper and mylar. I have also continued to learn 3D modeling and rendering with Zbrush and Keyshot.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>The work hasn't changed drastically but has morphed with the constant background noise of death and propaganda. I feel Covid lockdown has given us a taste of the future disaster living as climate change closes in. My work is reflecting the change, a bursting of life, death and transformation.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I have felt guilty not going out and joining the George Floyd protests. But the staying home has kept me in close access with my art. It's a very strange time warp, months blurring by, not knowing what will happen to our country, our society, feeling quite helpless and totally ashamed of our government.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I have created 46 works on paper and several 3D renderings all in the vein of microbiology, the theme I have been working with for the past 3 years. I have had time to photograph the work and think about how to install the work once Covid lockdown ends.</p>
