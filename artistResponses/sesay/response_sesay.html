<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>Yeah but my work is always changing. I revisited some older styles in order to paint at home early on in quarantine. The work has been influenced by internal and external dialogues so as conversations change, environments often follow.</p></div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>Being around friends and community. I love hosting friends at the studio and often work while in conversation so I miss that.
