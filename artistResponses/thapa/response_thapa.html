<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I miss the <a href="https://www.communityarts.org/classes/drawing-painting-printmaking" target="_blank">Shadelands Printmaking studio</a>. They have an etching press and I was able to prepare my copper and poly plate and print them in the same location. I can still work on plates at home but I cannot run proofs to check the progress of the image or make editions of my etchings.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I gathered together and organized my scrap printmaking paper and began working on some new collages. I also got a small Gelli plate and I have been making monoprints with acrylic paint.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p> My collages have become more complex and somewhat wild with either black and white papers or very bright papers. I like taking a chaotic pile of scrap paper, cutting it, pasting it, and possibly drawing or painting on it. It is one way of making sense out of this strange new world we live in.</p>
	<p>I also began a series of monoprints called "Little Houses". The iconic style houses are all the same shape and color but most of them are tilted or askew in some way.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I enjoyed the camaraderie of printing with a group of people. It's nice to have a second opinion when the work is in progress. It is harder to get motivated when I am working at home by myself.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I have filled one sketchbook and also finished a selection of larger works that seem to be trending towards organic landscapes and abstract pieces that focus on color and texture.</p>
