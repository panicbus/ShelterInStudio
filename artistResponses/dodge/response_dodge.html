<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Working at home during the pandemic has brought about major changes not only to the way I work but also to the amount and quality of feedback that I receive. I am primarily a painter and I have gone from working with other artists in a large studio to working in my tiny studio at home. I needed to buy an easel that was large enough to allow me to continue to paint on large canvases. Now most of the room in my studio is taken up by my giant easel and canvas. Luckily I have just enough room to paint. It was always easy to receive a quality critique of my work in progress from the professor that I was studying with and from my fellow artists. Now the interaction via Zoom is all that I have and while it is better than nothing, the quality of the experience is lacking the personal interaction that I am used to.</p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I have created new work during the past six months but the quantity of work that I have created is much lower than usual. I have found it difficult to concentrate on being creative during this time. The isolation and lack of social interaction has, at times, caused me to experience artist's block.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>The type of series that I am working on has changed. I was working on a SF Bay series of paintings and had planned to have about 10 paintings in the series</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>As I mentioned above, there have been many challenges which have included learning how to work in a really small studio space, having all of my art supplies delivered instead of going to the art store, learning how to critique my own work more efficiently and accepting the fact that socializing with other artists in the studio was no longer possible. Also, I am constantly fighting to overcome artist’s block.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>It was a big success for me to get my tiny at home studio up and running and workable. I have also had some limited successes dealing with artist’s block by working on art projects other that painting such as collage and life figure drawing. I joined an international life figure drawing group. It is run out of London and the models are from all over the world. It has been wonderful to work with a global community of artists. This online group did not exist before the pandemic. Changing my practice allows me to take a break from painting and when I come back to the canvas I can look at the painting refreshed and renewed.</p>
