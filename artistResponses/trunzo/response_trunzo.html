<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I had just got home from Mexico City where I attended the art fair, Zonamaco. It was a delightful trip filled with great art, cheap and very good food, fun, and drinks with friends and family.  We had not been out of the country for 11 years, so it was really special. I was on an art high and ready to go full force into the studio. Shelter-in-place happened a couple weeks after we got home. It seemed like a great opportunity to create my own artist residency.</p>
	<p>Luckily my studio and my weight lifting equipment are downstairs from my apartment, and I am an art supply hoarder as well. Choosing the long road of old world style process of making gesso, I built a canvas for my paintings using a recent score of a few free beautiful 48”x60” wood stretcher bars. When not art making I go through my art books and listened to podcasts about art.</p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I drew many self portraits, porch drawings, empty chair drawings, copies of famous artist self portraits, all men. I would attempt to queer myself into the pose and draw myself in the guise of these famous dead male artists' self portraits. I used their eyes and gestures to guide me.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Things were going smoothly and then the massacre was televised. I was working on an image for a self portrait that suddenly had to be about BLM. My eyes were opened and I could not close them. The terror was so deep. Mamma. I also painted a historical reference painting "May 25, 2020" based on Goya's "May 3, 1808" painting. Goya was one of the art books I was taking images from and queering myself into with self portraits. But after George Floyd, I could not help but paint this one. I am also working on another piece that is politically charged.</p>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>My challenges are white-privileged rooted. I am able work in my studio. I live in San Francisco. I miss being with my friends. I miss going to museums and seeing art live, in person. I miss galleries, dinner parties,  going to movies and thrift stores but life is not challenging as it has been and continues to be for my black and brown brothers and sisters. </p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I have been able to cruise through a lot of museums for free virtually. I bought some great art on line. Going through all the old art books also gave me some ideas about what the color palette should be in the large paintings that I am about to begin.</p>
	<p>I really dove into Goya's colors. I have been working on paper trying to develop this by making color charts. I only wish I could see Goya's paintings in person.</p>
