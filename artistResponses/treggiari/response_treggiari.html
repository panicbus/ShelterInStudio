<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>As an artist who’s practice has focused in the public realm, combining methodology that engages the viewer with societal inquiry along with social, interactive platforms, COVID-19 has presented many challenges. Social practice and community based methodology during COVID-19 has changed the landscape of how this work can be conducted in a profound way. The notion of engaging a participant in a public setting during today's new challenges are as abstract and unrealistic as going to your favorite restaurant. With these new challenges comes self reflectiveness in one's practice as well as the need to recalculate one's methods and objectives regarding a project.  </p>

	<p>Public space has turned into a necessity, especially during this global crisis.  With the various interpretations of re-opening that city leaders are imparting on its citizens and George Floyds tragic death,  we have seen a wave of citizens taking back the streets.  I believe public space can still act as a connector for community, but questions remain involving how a social practice artist can do this in a safe and appropriate manner. We have started to see artist responses already, which has manifested in murals that have beautified our communities since the death of George Floyd. Yes murals have been a major aspect of public art, but the amount of community creativity and passion being displayed during COVID-19 and George Floyd’s brutal murder has amplified story telling and creativity as a way for community to connect in a public realm.</p>

	<p>I have been deeply considering my own practice through writing, brainstorming, and reading. The stay at home order has allowed me to take the time to be reflective on my practice. Do I have definitive answers for what this means for my practice? No, I do not, but that is ok. I still remain as productive and creative as ever, while I work through these larger questions of my work in relation to these new realities of pandemic diseases and important fights for equality. Community based public methods will change and I am excited to keep working out what that will mean for me and my practice.</p></div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I have taken the past three months to search for these answers and have made some exciting creative strides. My studio and my house have been the main places I have gone during the stay-at-home order. The studio has allowed me to dive into new sculpture, set pieces, and painting projects that I have been interested in doing but had no time to execute. I have created a series of mobile billboards that can be deployed in the streets, along with a new sculptural set piece that furthers work I've been doing with housing issues in the Bay Area. This is not to say that my other projects have gone away! I've been busy with these as well, which includes drawing portraits of immigrant women chefs in Cincinnati to more poster making and video work. It has been a productive and creative time and the new work is propelling my practice in a wonderful new direction.</p></div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I would not say the work has changed, it has just shifted to adapt to this new world that we find ourselves in. This shift will allow us as artists to really experiment, thinking about innovative ways to conduct our work with these new restrictions. I find that exciting and scary at the same time. This shift will continue to push me in new directions and I have allowed myself to be open to that.</p></div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>One challenge for myself and my work has been the lack of human connection on a day to day basis. I thrive on these human connections and the use of Zoom and FaceTime, although fine, does not replace interacting with a person. As our communities open up, we will soon see more of each other, but the handshake and the hug is replaced with distance. This is a necessity, but also sad for me knowing that these acts of human connection are gone four us at this moment.</p>  

	<p>Another larger challenge has been the cancelation and reshuffling of exhibitions, grants, teaching, etc, which sustains my art practice and creativity. The unknown from month to month has created unknown in the world of exhibits, grants, and teaching. These are my passions as well as a revenue stream for myself and my work. I am currently working on new ways to address this gap and will continue to do this over the course of the year.</p></div> 

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>My main success is the quality time I can give to my creativity and art practice during the stay-at-home order. My studio practice has shifted slightly allowing for my new work to emerge and that has been exciting to develop. It has also been wonderful to spend more quality time with my wife, which has been challenging in the past because of our busy lives. The combination of these two things has brought me happiness.</p></div>
