<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">My studio has been moved into my kitchen. I've constructed a standing desk above the kitchen sink. Behind me is a wall to pin ideas to. It took weeks to settle into a working process, but what seems to work for me is coffee and fiction reading (Jamel Brinkley’s "A Lucky Man", Lorrie Moore "Self Help" ...oh! and Ottessa Moshfegh's "My Year of Rest and Relaxation"—a great book but way too on the nose to read while in quarantine). Generative artmaking or writing. Lunch. Lazy afternoon or research. Dinner. Drawing while watching docuseries.</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">I've certainly tried. I have started a couple different drawing series that I'm still not sure if they are working. I've made a lot of progress on a long term project that involves reacting to some slow-growing plants. I would say the most progress is that I feel like I have a deeper understanding of what my work needs.</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">Dramatically. I make sculpture and performance and social practice, all of which rely on public spaces, access to parks and the outdoors, and other people. Place and environment are some of my biggest inspirations—when the shelter in place order was announced, I was just getting into rigging my camera with an underwater case so I could study mussels growing in the Alameda estuary. Now I'm primarily studying bivalves through reading. Did you know the city of Warsaw has eight living clams rigged with switches that tell the city when the water supply is contaminated? They look, structurally speaking, exactly like my sculptures. I'm not sure if I would have come across these little guys had I not been spending hours and hours on the internet and on the phone with my art friends, one of whom sent me a link to the documentary about the clams ("Fat Kathy" just debuted yesterday).</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">The most interesting thing that has happened is in my long term project, which is to try to discover if a plant that moves with sunlight (called "nyctinastic" movement) could be consulted to set camera exposure. I've constructed five of these biohacker lightmeters and have been growing different nyctinastic plants in each since December. I had pretty much abandoned four, but the fifth, mimosa pudica, though growing the slowest was making the most reliable movement between day and night. I set up a <a href="https://www.sustainedbyvisions.com/wfs/lightmeter" target="_blank">timelapse</a> video to capture its movement. Ten hours into the timelapse my cat devoured the plant whole. All that was left was a little twiggy stem. I had set out to try to establish an interspecies relationship—I would provide the plant with ideal growing conditions, and it would tell me about the sun. I didn't count on a third species and her desires and needs.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">I'm really excited about the amount of research I've been able to do and how that will inform what I make when I have more space and my shop at my disposal. I went down a rabbit hole looking at the history of mimosa pudica in scientific literature. It turns out to have inspired the first description of circadian rhythm, written in France by Jacques de Mairan, and continues to be a plant that is used for research on plant memory and communication. I discovered through de Mairan that a Swedish botanist, Carl Linnaeus, hypothesized a clock that relies on flowers that open at different hours of the morning. When you find that a rope you’ve been pulling is attached to a whole system that was previously unseen is so rewarding.</div>
