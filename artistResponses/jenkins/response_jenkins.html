<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">The hardest impact has been on my responsibilities outside of my art practice. With two young children, an in person ceramics teaching job, and online art history classes it has been difficult to transition to being at home full time. I also have not had access to my usual studio or certain materials. I had a show planned for October, but the gallery has dropped off the map and are not answering my emails and calls. I am however still working on things.</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">Since the limitations have hindered what I was planning on doing, I have taken to a deep experimental process. I have built a wood kiln in my backyard and am currently exploring what that will lead to. I have no idea if it will all come together into something that fits with my usual body of work, but I really don't care at the moment.</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">I've been interested in the same types of things for sometime now, but I am feeling more of a draw towards these ideas. I'm obsessed with human history, ingenuity, and accessing the past to make sense of the future. I think this mode of thinking has served me well in the past and is helping me get through the present.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">My challenges have been mostly domestic. Making sure one kid is engaging with school work while the other is also growing and learning. Breaking up fights over who gets what cup, toy, or whatever. Getting the kids to not go into the apartment downstairs where my mother in law who doesn't believe in the pandemic lives. Going to the grocery store all suited up and then stripping down, showering, then wiping each item with alcohol. Dealing with the overwhelming stress in my daily thoughts, reactions, and in my body where it manifests into intense muscular pain. All the while trying to come up with some idea that will make people think and feel, plus finding the time to make it.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">When I was 14 I grew 6 inches over the summer. I had severe "growing pains" and cramps in my legs, but by September I was as taller and stronger. I feel like that now. I hear the divine mysterious voice that tells artists what to do and it's quite loud. I feel myself becoming more something, I'm just not sure what it is. If I had more time and/or money I would be producing a shit ton of work, but that's always the case. I am however working with what I've got, exploring, and discovering.</div>
