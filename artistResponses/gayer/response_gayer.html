<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">At the beginning of the shelter in place mandate I began applying for more grants for projects and was able to take care of a lot of long-over-due edits to my website. But the weight of the pandemic and impact on friends and family began to influence my ability to concentrate on my practice at all. I don't feel motivated to read any theory books that I've been meaning to read or write any critical essays I've been meaning to write. I feel like I'm stagnating, but I keep reminding myself that it is ok not to produce right now and I'm looking towards projects that are more community-focused.</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Yes, I co-founded a virtual studio visit project that uses community raised funds to pay artists and arts organizers who have been financially impacted by COVID-19. The project is called TBD Salon. We partner with arts non profits to help us raise funds for each studio visit and work with artists and arts organizers across the country. You can find out more info here: <a href="https://tbdsalon.cargo.site/" target="_blank">https://tbdsalon.cargo.site/</a>.</p>
<p>I've also begun working on a staff art show for SFMOMA staff members. It will be online and we are looking into staff members being able to sell their work listed on a separate website from the museum website. It will include SFMOMA staff who have been laid off; it's still in progress and has not launched. But, we are hoping to instill a sense of community and support through this effort.</p></div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Yes, one exhibition I was curating was postponed to an undetermined time frame. The exhibition was to open at the Knockdown Center in New York in June 2020. Given the location and the unpredictability of the virus right now, the staff at the Knockdown are unable to provide a new opening date for the show, which I completely understand. I'm just happy that they haven't cancelled the show entirely. The decision made me hold off from working any more on the exhibition like shipping artworks, loan agreements, or exhibition layout details. </p>

<p>I was also invited to my first writing group. It has allowed me to explore more creative forms of writing and find an outlet for all of what I'm experiencing right now with a supportive group of friends. It feels good to provide feedback for their work and see them grow.</p> 
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>My mother was diagnosed with 4th stage pancreatic cancer about 3 weeks into the shelter in place mandate. The reality for her extended family and friends to see her has been incredibly difficult because we don't want the virus to spread, but also want her closest people to say their goodbyes. For me, I'm trying to dig myself out of a dark place with the news of her illness as well as the bleak outlook of the future in the coming year or years due to the pandemic. I have been full time care taking and it has limited the time and emotions I am able to put into the projects I mentioned above.</p>

<p>I'm also in an uncertain time with my employment at SFMOMA. It was just announced that the museum will be making another round of staff layoffs, and I am unsure where I stand in those decisions. I won't know until next week. I feel like I've worked really hard to get to the position I'm in and will feel pretty lost in regards to next steps if I am laid off. The decision by the museum has also left the staff feeling really disappointed and the morale is really low. Beyond the staff art show, I am struggling to find ways to support my colleagues while also preserving my mental health amongst my sadness with my mother's illness.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>I've been asking my mother to tell me about her life, in short segments, and I record the conversations. I'm not sure what I'll do with all the content, but perhaps it can find a way into my curatorial practice. It seems to give me hope that I have these recordings.</p>

<p>For TBD Salon, many people and organizations who we have reached out to have said "yes" to working with us. It's an incredible feeling to know that folks see this project as worthwhile and want to grow it with us. It has also been a way for me to reconnect with people who in turn have supported me emotionally through this tough period with my mother's illness. It has been an incredible support system. At this point in time we have raised $975 for artists and arts organizers! I'm so enlivened by my community and desire to continue to connect.</p>
