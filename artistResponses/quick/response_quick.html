<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>It’s difficult to say. On a practical level, I’ve moved my studio to my apartment. So, I’ve been working at home, which creates various logistical challenges and benefits. In terms of content and execution, being at home hasn’t at this point changed the work itself. It may in the future, as I am thinking more about how to incorporate more everyday contexts for my videos, which usually have more formal and fanatical settings.</p></div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>Yes, I have completed some costumes for what was supposed to be a new performance. I am continue to prototype haptic electronic sound modules. I am creating a new video piece for the Wattis.</p></div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>I’ve had to restructure what was supposed to be a live performance into a short video. My practice is only sometimes collaborative and I was supposed to be spending this time working with dancers, choreographers, musicians, and a composer. But all of this in on hold.</p></div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>I have had a number of exhibitions, residencies, and jobs cancelled or postponed. The challenge is that in working in performance and installation, the work is typically not completed until the exhibition or event. So, I have projects that I have been working on that will not have a fully realized completion until life resumes. This ultimately effects the future progression of my work, as completed projects and the documentation that they produce lead to future grants and exhibitions.</p></div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>I was asked to create a short video segment for a fundraiser and shot and edited the video in my apartment in a day. Making this video quickly and in a barebones ways was a very refreshing and new process for me. Normally it takes me a very long time to make work. Also, making this video demonstrated to me that even in these weird times there’s still a desire for some levity and joy.</p></div>
