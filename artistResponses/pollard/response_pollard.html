<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">My practice before graduate school was almost entirely digital. When I got to the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) in 2018, I ended up going in what seemed to be the opposite direction. My practice evolved into being very hands-on, where I experimented with MDF, caution tape and concrete for example. Since being stuck at home, I have been pushing myself to experiment more in a digital way. Videos and sound pieces have become a large part of my studio practice, along with digital drawings and incorporating objects that I find around my house with my printed photographic images. On the flip side of that, I have been taking a lot of photographs on my daily walks around my neighborhood. I feel like I am letting myself make anything and everything I want to, just because I want to, and that feeling has been really exciting.</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">I have been able to continue to make something new on a weekly basis. Some days I get in the zone and work for five or six hours straight, while other days I take more time to relax and just think. I am very fortunate that I am able to create new works on the computer, and I have been working with my photo archive. Making work grounds me, and it motivates me, which is especially important during this transition phase of my life. I just graduated with my MFA during a global pandemic, the art world as we know it is in a state of metamorphosis, and I moved back in with my parents among other things. I have no idea what the future holds, but making art helps me process. I feel a certain peace being back at home though, maybe it's because I have taken up gardening or don't have to worry about paying rent.</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">My work has definitely shifted during this time. Since I don't have access to a woodshop, or a separate studio space, and since I have moved back in with my parents for the foreseeable future, I have had to make big changes in the way I approach my process. I have embraced the digital component of my practice. I have begun to make video and sound pieces that explore my relationship to my new, yet familiar surrounding of my childhood home in San Jose, California, as well as mixed media prints on dibond or aluminum that incorporate digital drawings I've done and found objects from around the house. I've also been installing the work all throughout my parent's house which has been a lot of fun.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">The biggest challenge I am currently facing is the absence of my San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) community. I graduated with my MFA just a few weeks ago (May 2020), and it has been an interesting two years. I feel grateful for the experiences that I had while in school, and truthfully, I am completely honored to have been able to share that space with my classmates, friends, and to have learned from some really incredible people and artists. I'm already feeling nostalgic. It truly is a special place. In the face of the unthinkable, the school’s possible closure, it was nothing short of inspirational to see our community come together. While it took me a year or so to really understand what was going on, I have realized since being stuck at home, that SFAI taught me two of the most cliche, yet beautiful lessons that I needed to learn in regards to art, which is impermanence and experimentation. As alum Nao Bustamante so boldly advised in our commencement ceremony, "Follow the love", and I couldn’t agree more. </div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">I think the biggest success I've had thus far is that I have overcome not taking my creative process so seriously. I have shed previous expectations that I had for myself, and I really feel like I am at a place where more and more of myself is coming through in the work. Being away from my usual facilities has really challenged me to experiment in ways I wouldn't have if I still had access to my school studio. I would say, my biggest success has been learning how to let go of my own expectations of what art can/should be, and to really embrace and enjoy the process of making, because that's what I love to do.</div>
