<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I am a mom of a one year old who spends most of my time with him. I work part time, from home. So it's probably affected my art practice (which is also my job) less than many. I spent a lot of my time at home before. But being stuck at home has also overlapped with the incredible whiteness-unraveling-BIPOC-uprising that is happening in the so-called USA right now, and that has affected my practice in excellent ways. There's been a breakdown in any areas of my life / our collective life that were business-as-usual, unconscious or unexamined. The examination, the seeing and transforming new layers is intense, welcome, sorrowful, and very exciting and joyful. </p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I create a monthly interactive talk series, and I've done a few during this time. And lots of writing. The last one was called On Cultivating White Resilience, designed for my fellow white people to cultivate our resilience to become safer and less racist for BIPOC.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>There's been a freeing sense, at the beginning of quarantine, and since during this uprising, to not keep going with anything that is not working that I've been ignoring. To become braver than ever to look deeply at all of it. That feels so good, so true, so important, full of love.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>People who don't have kids describe quarantine as boring or full of so much "extra" time, etc. My experience hasn't changed that much in that I spend so much time with a one year old magic human. I love it, it's so built into and is becoming more of my art practice in the best ways, in the complex ways (ie how do I want to parent my child so that we can all become less racist?). Not sure in this context (of endless devastation for BIPOC specifically in corona time) I would even describe it as a challenge, but something I've been working to see in a more creative holistic ways is the lack of childcare from people outside of our family. We've changed our schedule because of it, and what I can do and when for my art practice / business has changed a lot too, continues to change. Mostly I see this as an invitation to new kinds of creativity and resource sharing.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>A new feeling of freedom and commitment to antiracist practice in my everyday, finding ways that practice is showing up that I wasn't seeing and putting it in places where it wasn't. All of this comes from the inspiration I've received from so many people, so many Black and indigenous people specifically, leading the way. I've been involved in prison abolition work for about a decade and I have been completely shocked by how defunding the police and abolition have become mainstream vocabulary. I never expected that, I had given up on that ever happening in my lifetime, and this was a very important lesson for me in not succumbing to my white apathy. Through so much heartbreak and death, there is so much to be inspired by. That's been a success that I can't claim as mine, but that is the most important right now for me.</p>
