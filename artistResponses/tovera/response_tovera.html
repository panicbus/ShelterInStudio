<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
  <p>Sheltering in place has been grounding and confrontational. The change in time and space due to our healing crisis has allowed reflection and the opportunity to focus on rebuilding systems that do not function or are out of balance.</p>

	<p>I've been using the space to create a new flow, spending more time exploring meditation; recently adding chanting --Kirtan to my daily practice. I have always wanted to bring Ashram living to my studio space and by being sheltered I've been able to create a retreat-like environment. Since this shift I noticed my dreams have been more vivid, I've had an abundance of time and energy, and I've been more open-hearted towards myself and others; a true blessing of growth in my relationship, spiritual, and creative space. </p>
 </div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
 <p>The first month of sheltering was focused on grants, funding, and optimizing the studio for online functionality on the web. The second month I focused on revamping the California studio, building removable air lock walls, reorganizing storage, and clearing the office. The third month I received many of the supplies I ordered and was able to set up and prepare for new projects. I am now working on a new sculpture and painting series.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>It has changed in a way that I feel more clear about my vision and my trajectory. I am excited for projects to become realized. New growth and exploration has sprouted a finer quality of upgrades. Integrating new standards and feeling how all is connected has been powerful. I imagine my art practice over the years looking like a funnel form where all is distilling into a concentrated potent point.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>The biggest challenge has been around staying balanced with all of the uncertainty, fear of change and loss within our community. Some days I have to grieve, to let the heavy energy move through me. There are days I have to do nothing and be in deep rest. Hot baths, listening to mindful meditations, and enjoying wholesome foods have been helpful. Other challenges have been sourcing materials for the studio as art stores have been closed, delayed projects, and cancelled exhibits. Though I think using all these set-backs to propel us is necessary.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Some successes have been generating sales, optimizing the office and setting up the studio for new work. All of the change has been foundational. At the beginning of the year I opened a second studio in Brooklyn, New York where I've been able to create a more modular studio for projects to have mobility. Having a satellite studio has enabled more access and connection to the East coast and overseas.</p>
	<p>Overall I am feeling a new center of balance and strength. My goal is to continue to maintain focus and awareness to nourish inspiration and connection to our planet, to our human race, and to our mind, body and spirit. Art has been an incredible vehicle of expression for the love and fear we have inside. It is a beautiful dance.</p>
