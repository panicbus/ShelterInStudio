<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>I have really been forced to sit still and examine my practice. There is no excuse now, "no time" doesn't  apply since its all I had. I was able to make the things I wanted to while looking at the way my life had changed - what now I introduced to my life that wasn't before.</p>
 </div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>Oh, a ton! Quite a few pieces, not sure if anyone will ever see them, but I have made a lot of work.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>I taught myself how to airbrush, which is way outside of my normal way of working. I am a sculptor and a photographer so painting is not something I dealt with - however, it was the catalyst for what I eventually ended up making. Painting was low stakes for me and allowed me to work quickly and learn a new way of seeing with the transparency found in airbrushing, it also got me to expand how I create and make - being in my body a different way rather than the way I am in my body when I am making my very labor intensive</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>Daily motivation. It's very easy to get inside yourself and in your head in a time like this rather than be in your body. I find myself running full steam ahead for a few days then binging Netflix for a few.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>My successes have been reminding myself I am still creative, that exercises in making don't have to be do or die - that there is a freedom in being an artist. This time has really allowed me to remember I am a maker and an artist as well - I have really stepped back from my making process in the past two years - my mindset was very disconnected with my art and my practice. I have reconnected with my practice, although very painful at times, I have reconnected none the less.</p>
