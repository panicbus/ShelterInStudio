<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I have had more time to devote to making work. Being creative is one of my best strategies for dealing with uncertainty and difficult times. One of the first things I did when I heard that the shelter-in-place order had come out for my town was to immediately dive into working on a film project that I had planned on shooting in my yard.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Yes, I have created or completed more new work in this period than at any time since Grad School.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
 <div class="answer">
	<p>Yes and no. I work in photography, film and performance. I had a performance scheduled a couple days before the SIP orders came out. That was cancelled, and there haven't really been many opportunities since then for that type of work. My performances are interactive, so they don't translate well into a video chat environment. In terms of film and photography, the quarantine has given me a lot of extra time to focus on creating and completing work that is very involved and that I wouldn't normally have time for. That part has been a huge plus for me.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>The biggest challenge has been deciding which idea to go forward with. I have more creative ideas than I have time for, even now. Sometimes it is difficult to decide which one I need to work on at which time.</p>
	<p>The secondary challenge is financial. Though I now have time, I don’t have a great of deal funds on account of also being mostly unemployed. Fortunately I have the time to find workarounds and alternate ways of doing things. Helping my daughter navigate 3rd grade online was also a challenge.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I have been very excited about completing a number of long-term art projects that have been waiting for me to finish them up. Some of them are very complicated pieces that I conceptualized almost a decade ago, before I had access to computers that were powerful enough to complete them. The extra time this period has given made it possible to dive in and create workflows that would let me bring these to completion. I was also able to spend time finalizing several bodies of work, which is a big relief.</p>
	<p>In looking at how I chose to spend my time and how several other artists have chosen to spend theirs, I am reminded that we do these things because we really want to do them. Even when everything else is closed down, we are still creating new works, which strikes me as a beautiful thing.</p>
