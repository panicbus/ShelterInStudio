<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>This might just be my dream come true being "stuck at home" painting away.  That said, I've really had to get creative to find new subject matter and I miss having shows and teaching.  Since more time is being spent trying to do things in a Covid19 safe manner it leaves less time to work.  And everyone is calling and texting and posting which I find interesting but cuts into my work time.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Yes I've done 35 plus paintings since March which is quite a few for me.  I often only do 35 to 40 a year especially if they are larger in format.  I joined an international group of artists doing 20 still life florals from life in 30 days.  That was quite a challenge but really helped jump start me since I was a bit of a deer in the headlights when this all began.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I'm not sure it's changed but I do believe I am willing to fail more and I think that is leading me in some new directions.  Taking more chances seems easier when you are "stuck in the studio." So far I like the work I've done and feel I've grown significantly.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>My biggest challenge has been working larger.  I have a limited amount of studio space and I'm not sure what I will do with a lot of large completed paintings.  There do not seem to be many buyers right now, especially for more expensive works.  And then getting the work framed is another hurdle.  I frame some of the smaller pieces and have been able to get the frames. </p>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>My biggest project that I had procrastinated for a long time was to build a new website and have it be user friendly and have the ability to do sales directly.  It's just recently done so I don't know how that will go but so far I've had good feedback.  But so much to learn!  My other biggest success was to break through on a new subject matter.  I've driven by the boats in Monterey over and over and see them from the road above in all kinds of weather.  Finally I decided to create a series around them.  I've enjoyed this even more than the flowers.</p>
