<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>As an artist-run exhibition space that focuses on supporting the experimental projects of local and regional artists, as well as trying to foster a community of support for this type of practice, our biggest challenge has been thinking of ways we can continue to host energetic openings in the age of COVID-19. The openings bring support for the art and artists, and are dependent on the energy of the crowd, who bring anticipation, excitement, conversation, and a lot of dialog to the space. Many people hang out until well past the official close of the evening, filtering back and forth between the installation and the reception. This is only possible because TGTG is located on Jefferson's home property - it was a literal garage before it became his workshop & studio, and later The Garage on the Grove.</p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>We've been busy ramping up our programming to be year round, starting with artists Vincent Pacheco and Jodi Connelly this Fall. Moving ahead means we have to try to tackle the issues of COVID and social distancing for our openings in a way that is as safe as possible, compliant with public health recommendations, and authentic to what our space is all about. We've partnered with friend of the Garage, artist Steve Briscoe, to help us design spaces that comply with safety protocols and that can be installed all over the property - little corrals people can hang out in all night with their quarantine pods.</p>

	<p>As a separate project, we're launching a semi-annual zine called rvrsEDGE (river's edge) with help from friends of the Garage, artists Peter Foucault, and Tom & Erin Betthauser.</p>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Both Jen and Jefferson have project management backgrounds, as do Peter and Steve. This has all come into play big time with the new projects we've launched in response to COVID, so tapping these day job skills is definitely a change in the way we work. Much time is spent on creating google sheets and folders on share drives - something that we never bothered with before for TGTG. Zoom, of course, also has a big role in our process now!</p>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Not burning out on meetings.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Keeping momentum on our idea to somehow merge COVID compliance with the social aspect of TGTG openings. It's been daunting. The range of solutions are generally expensive or ineffective for our purposes, but we've committed to finding that balance</p>
