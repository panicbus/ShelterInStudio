<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">I am a student in an MFA program. On campus, I have the largest studio I've worked in so far. It's filled with gorgeous light and I am surrounded by magic, creative people. My home studio is a large closet with a built in desk, and a cute little window. I guess you could say that I have downsized my studio, but I have expanded my art practice into my apartment.</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">During this time of sheltering-in-place I have created an unexpected amount of new work. I have found that the extra time of not commuting gives me time to read and think, which helps fuel my creating practice. Additionally, I feel like I have found new materials to work with. I am using what I had reserved for costumes and decorations to make artwork. It's been a playful process.</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">This time at home has freed me to make my work more personal. Before I was working with certain themes and alluding to specifics. I am still working within the same themes but since I am incorporating my personal objects my work has become more about my live experiences. </div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">I have not been able to make messes, and that has been a challenge. It is more difficult to get lost in creating when I need to be aware of where paint or glue might drop. I am also feeling the loss of social interactions around art. Not being able to drop into someone's studio and have a conversation is a missed interaction.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">I have continued my installation practice through developing apartment interventions. Apartment interventions are installations that we have to interact with in order to proceed with our day. They disrupt doorways and block the use of drawers. These interventions often reflect how it feels to be outside interacting with the world right now. I've also had to improve my documentation of my work because no one will ever see the installations I am creating here in person. Additionally, through a dream I found new drawing subject matter.</div>
