<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">My daily routine has not changed much. I have been self-employed for a couple of years now and I am used to having a flexible schedule. I have been spending a lot of time in the studio, since there are less work related activities I want to take advantage of having all this extra time making art. I have been preoccupied with a few personal projects lately and I am taking part in some really interesting collective projects also. Emotionally, I am experiencing a lot of the collective anxiety and grief, and being productive in the studio feels like a wonderful distraction right now.</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">Yes. I am working on a few series that involve handmade view cameras, vanitas inspired photographs, a lot of electronic waste and drawings.</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">My current project involves making stereo view cameras and using them as "visual mediation devices" to produce digital images. I began this project in early March, so in a way the work is evolving along with the Covid-19 outbreak. This pandemic has made me realise the degree I have become dependent on the media. From the daily news to all the Zoom interactions, social media and the emergence of many collective projects, the media is my means for communication, yet I am also aware that it is being used for spreading misinformation and censorship. I am thinking about the media as both a channel and a barrier and I have been trying to explore that in my work.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">I am in a privileged position right now where I can spend a lot of time in the studio and focus on making art. I have a lot of anxiety with the uncertainty of freelance work, although I am still maintaining some of the remote work that I do, such as printing, and I am figuring out virtual ways to offer more services through teaching online. Also, Iâ€™m struggling a bit with the fact that I have families overseas and knowing I can't travel and visit in the foreseeable future.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">Personally, being overly ambitious seems to not work in the current environment. I enjoy being productive in the studio and making art brings me joy. When it comes to the mundane part of life, if I manage a day answering emails, keeping the house in order, having exercised, I see these little victories as a success.</div>
