<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>Initially, the shutdown negatively effected my practice. The disruption of my daily habits lead to a decrease in motivation and drive, and I overestimated how much time I had in each day. Much of my time was spent doing other things and with the amount of extra time I had, I felt as if I had plenty of time to paint, so I didn’t work in the present. After about a month, this passed and I actively decided to dedicate a part of every day to painting.</p> 
<p>For several years I have been working through a major transition in my work, especially regarding my emotional relationship with my process, and initially, things didn’t feel any different. I was frustrated and dissatisfied with what I was making. However the shutdown and all of this extra time I had catalyzed an awareness of a thought pattern that was influencing my every move when I was painting: I was always in a hurry. I always needed to be done, not doing, I was always behind. Others were achieving success and I had a lot of catching up to do. I was never fully engaged with my work; my head was always in the future and needed every painting to be done. I needed success. But now with all this extra time, no day job to go to, no deadlines for shows or applications... Why was I still hurrying? What's the rush? It was quite visceral when I had this "aha" moment, I literally had this cathartic wave of euphoria wash over my body and it made me laugh with relief. I realized how these thoughts were always running in the background, and how they had a direct impact on my emotional state while I was creating. I painted for a few hours that night and it felt quite effortless and enjoyable. It helped me get back in touch with the necessary presence, detachment, and playfulness that’s essential for creativity.</p> 
<p>I wish I could say that my work has forever changed because of that one moment, but I still find myself going back to my old habits, feeling anxious and rushed. But thankfully I now have an awareness of my state of mind and am actively trying to maintain a healthier relationship with creating.</p></div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">Yes, I’ve produced about four or five new paintings, and have progressed on many others that were in the works before the lockdown.</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">It has definitely become looser, more relaxed. My work is abstract, utilizing a lot of gestural paint application and intuitive color choices, and Ive noticed myself being less methodical and uptight about the outcome. I am more engaged with the process and more accepting of failure, which has lead to dramatically different results.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">My biggest challenge has been letting go of the outcome. My old mental habits still need every painting, every mark, to be right. Every piece needs to be better than everything I've done before... Which is just another aspect of the destructive emotional habits and egoic desires that have ultimately been hindering my progress. So while it's not related directly to the lockdown, it's what I've been wrestling with. Im fortunate enough to have financial stability, a home studio, and ample supplies to create, so my challenges have been mostly internal.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">My work has taken a turn because of my new and developing awareness, which has definitely been my greatest success.</div>
