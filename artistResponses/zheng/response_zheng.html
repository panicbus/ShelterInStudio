<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">All-in-all it's been positive (sorry no pun intended.). The shelter-in-place has made it easier for me to focus on making art. </div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Yes. In fact, I have been super productive and have developed the drawings into a new body of work.</p>  
<p>This period coincides with a flow situation that I have been in since the beginning of this year, when I started doing line drawings. It was triggered by a performance that I did in Victoria, British Columbia at the end of last year, for which I did a drawing as meditation on a wall.</p> 
<p>Since I came home, I have been doing similar drawings on paper. The quarantine took place soon after that and it kept the distractions away and I have been burying myself in the studio doing these drawings. Since then I have developed it into a series of work based on a simple idea of "Draw A Line And Follow It". I'm still in the midst of that flow, which is really great.</p></div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">Yes drastically. Prior to this, I had been doing performance predominantly. Now I'm fully occupied doing line drawings.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>The main challenge has been the inability to show works due to the Coronavirus. Several shows have been canceled, including a wall drawing performance in Oregon. On the other hand, because the show was canceled, I decided to do the wall drawing in my own studio and I like what happened.</p> 
<p>The other difficulty is that I haven't been able to see friends. The lack of human contact has been hard.</p></div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">The undistracted large chunk of time has allowed me not to rush in my work. I have been able to take time to really simmer the works. The rigor and creativity seem to be unusually high. Small breakthroughs happen more often. In fact, after I've experimented with the various drawings on paper, now I'm doing it again on large walls, but with nuances and a new dimension resulted from the experiments on paper.  I'm very happy about that.</div>
