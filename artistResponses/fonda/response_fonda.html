<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>Yes. As a community college professor, transitioning to teaching studio classes online has been a bit overwhelming and depressing. At the beginning of the pandemic, there was a moment when I thought stationing in place would equal more studio time, but that hasn't been the case. I don't have the same energy or motivation. I do go to my studio a few times a week across town but my reasons are more or less evenly split, leaving the house just to be somewhere else, versus actually working on anything in there. Sometimes I just go and sit in my space. At home, creative energies have been spent on our yard and our meals. Otherwise, I'm logging a lot of hours in our home office, a room in which I've never really spent much time in before now.</p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I have created some new work in this time, not much, but some. I take a lot of long walks and take a lot of pictures during these walks. I ended up making posters of some of my Instagram grids to raise money for Black Lives Matter and other social justice organizations. That isn't really my normal thing but the process of creating the images and producing something physical was gratifying in the same way my more typical processes are. There is also a painting I've been working since the beginning of the year that I've painted over more times that I can count. It has a really built up surface which is also not my normal thing. I'm in no hurry to finish it. I was planning to do a series of these and still would like to, but it isn't feeling like what I want to work on right now. That series is introspective and abstract.  I think I'm a little to sick of myself right now to be that introspective. There is so much going on in the world. I'm not sure these very abstract pieces are speaking to me in the same way they did in February and March. I've been sketching during zoom meetings and see some potential for painting some of those things but it is a completely different direction. </p>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I've also been working on some public art projects but so far that has mostly meant "paper work" or filling out various forms online, which doesn't satisfy any of my creative urges or inclinations but still needs to get done. I've done small public art projects in the past but this is my first really significant one. I'm so excited about this opportunity but  have also been experiencing bouts of crippling doubt and imposter's syndrome. Once I get my hands on the actual materials I know I'll feel better about everything. Both for better and for worse, I know this about myself: I use my time more wisely when I have less of it. I'm a bit appalled at how much time I've squandered in the last few months. I do believe I'm dealing with some low key depression. It's no one thing, it's all these tiny things adding up with no relief in sight. The stress of changing my teaching methods, the fear of this virus, the isolation, the monotony, all the terrible news and feeling a little hopeless and helpless to do much about any of it. I miss running into people casually. I miss spending languid hours in coffee shops. I miss other people's art and art shows and art openings. I miss museum visits. I miss witnessing my students learn in person. I miss feeling like I know what I'm doing. I miss traveling. I miss having things to look forward to.</p>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I helped my parents move closer to me in all of this which is a great relief during this scary time.</p> 
	<p>I begrudgingly took a time consuming online class this summer learning how to teach better online and do actually feel more confident going back into this stuff in the Fall.</p> 
	<p>I have plenty of ideas to pursue.</p>
	<p>You'd never know by looking at it but my studio is slowly getting cleaned up and organized.</p>
