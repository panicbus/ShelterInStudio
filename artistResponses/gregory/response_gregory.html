<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>I’m the mother of an eight-year-old and a one-year-old. I was the primary caregiver for both girls prior to quarantine,and worked part time for Sacramento State as a photography professor thanks to a collage of childcare from three different providers. My eight-year-old is in second grade at our local school. Now I am trying to homeschool my second grader and provide all the care for my baby, except for one day a week when we have retained one of our babysitters for a few hours. He lives alone and is a very responsible quarantin-er, and he’s working on his PhD, so he’s able to control how many people he sees. We’re essentially quarantining together with him. So I have almost no time where I can reliably work. The six hours a week I get on Fridays go toward a little exercise, some more focused time with my older daughter—because she’s really been struggling with all the changes in her life, and the loss of school and her teachers and her friends—and sometimes some house projects that I can’t do with the baby, grocery shopping, or a phone call to a friend, or a little bit of time drawing, painting and taking classes in watercolor and drawing.</p>
<p>I’m a social practice artist, and a photographer, so I’m not usually a mark maker. Even before quarantine, I had been feeling a strong urge to make work in a new or different way than I have in the past ten years or so. I came to the end of a series of projects that were all very similar, and it was a really positive, exciting end, and I wanted to take time after that to think about how I would embark on my next longer-term project, and how to really make sure the micro-level of making was different in it, as well as the theme and the overall structure. So now that I can’t put serious chunks of time into anything professional, it has felt great to try to learn some new skills by taking online classes—informally, through CreativeBug—and to go back to the kinds of playful making I used to do as a kid and a young adult. Basically, I’m treating art as a hobby at the moment, instead of as a profession, and that’s really fun and both novel and comforting. Although it’s very temporary—very much tied to this time where my baby can’t be left alone and I’m constantly on call for her. It’s also the sort of fallow period between big projects, where you start to gather yourself for the next one, both intellectually and energetically.</p>
<p>I’ve read lots of articles where parents describe their heroic patterns of working at night after their children are asleep... that’s just not a reality for me. I am not a night person—I get to about 7 pm after a full day of interacting with my kids and I can barely make a sentence anymore, let alone do complex intellectual, emotional or physical work. I always see art as the highest possible form of intellectual pursuit—not that it’s higher than other things, but that it’s equal to other things that we would think of conventionally as the height of complexity and skill. That doesn’t mean that every practitioner reaches the highest expression of the form, but I always want to be working toward that as a goal. So that’s not something I want to tackle while brain-dead. And I feel pretty silly noodling around with watercolor and when I have no real skills in that department, and definitely no complexity or subtlety. But I also believe in finding ways to make yourself happy, following intuition, and trying to preserve mental health as both a person in quarantine and as a parent, so I’m trying to stifle the judgement and just allow myself to have fun. Learning this kind of skill and doing small works on paper are also things I can be interrupted in and still come back to without losing my place, so to speak. So they are really fitting in with my current limitations. And I can these things with my older daughter, which feels great and helps me support her learning.</p>
<p>I miss working a lot. I definitely worry about my professional momentum, and have moments where I wonder what’s going to emerge from this time. I am certainly not immune to existential professional doubt. (And fear and anxiety in general.) But those things pale in comparison to my awareness of the extreme privilege I am speaking from. I have had—and continue to have—so many choices in both my personal and professional life, and so much support from my family. Nothing about my concerns compares to the job insecurity, food insecurity, home insecurity, and health insecurity that most people are dealing with in one way or another right now. My biggest day to day worry is keeping my mental health good, so that I can be a good mom and support my girls appropriately as we all get through this. I think everyone is having to work hard to find mental and emotional and physical health right now—some people amidst extreme adversity. And any one of us could be on the brink of seeing our lives turned upside down, or even end abruptly.</p></div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>I have an ongoing practice of photographing my children in nature, and during certain moments of their childhoods that say something about my parenting, their environment, or their personalities. That’s something I developed when I was first home with my older daughter, when she was a baby. So that’s seamlessly woven into my daily life and I am always making new work to a certain extent through that modality. Though it has a very limited scope and audience—I just post those pictures to a private Instagram account.</p>
<p>I’m also constantly researching. I’m thinking about a new project now, so I’m looking at things interest me that could tie into it, and learning about other artists, ideas and resources that could help me once I really begin the work.</p>
<p>I’ve also been making these small works on paper, mostly in the form of cards I send to friends and family. I’ve toyed with the idea of making them printable, so that I could release them to a wider audience, but I haven’t moved ahead with that yet.</p></div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">I have found myself trying to adapt some of the intellectual ways that I approach my work to my parenting more overtly recently. I always think about parenting creatively, and try to bring some of the same intentionality to my life that I bring to my work, but I think now that I am kind of trapped in my personal life without ANY professional life, I’m trying to do that even more, and help myself be even more aware of it, so that I can find more joy in what I am doing. Every few weeks I feel myself hit a wall and I try to recommit to enjoying my daughters and this kind of relentless time with them. Interestingly, it’s really not that different from what I wanted for myself anyway, while my baby is a baby (I love babies!) but removing just those few extra hours of time where I could work each week has affected my happiness a lot. I was also teaching last term, and I’m not this term, and that’s very different. I love the intellectual and social gymnastics of teaching, and I miss my students and my colleagues. Though I don’t know how I’d be managing to continue teaching remotely while caring for a maniacal baby, so I think I lucked out there overall.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <ul>
        <li>Zero professional relevance outside the home.</li>
        <li>A worry that I am not helping my community enough at this difficult time.</li>
        <li>Maintaining energy and creativity amidst the demands of my domestic work.</li>
        <li>Not being able to work at all as a professional.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">Learning, and wanting to learn. Making small works, even if they are silly and decorative, with zero depth, nuance or skill. ;) Cooking beautiful meals for my family. Helping my daughters learn at home (and only at home.) Feeling in love with my partner, and appreciating all that he does for our family. Feeling good about myself as a mom, neighbor, colleague, friend, daughter, sister and wife.</div>
