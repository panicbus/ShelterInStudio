<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>I stopped painting for 6 weeks. I sat on the back porch and stared at the garden. I got a dog and poured loved into it. I recognized the inconsequential nature of my work. I had always longed for a period of time like this to work, but when it came, I couldn't do anything.  Now I am getting back to it. I have signed on to some great workshops and that has given me entry back into the studio. I feel like I am going to be doing something new and different. I am trying to get back to the rich and joyful experience of painting now. I am working in a structured way like I am a student. </p> 
<p>I started giving paintings away via social media. </p>
<p>I have watched a lot of Art 21 and Louisiana TV art interviews.</p>
<p>I have looked at a lot of my old work and feel strong affection for it... it's BC - before covid. Hopes, paths and pursuits were so different then.</p></div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">Yes. I have been painting on 22 x 30 300 pound paper. Landscapes. Abstractions. I am painting clouds small in oil.  

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">I am not so interested in what I used to do. I am leaning in to a new direction and until I get there I am doing exercises from the classes I am taking - finding them very rich!  My mind is open to learn now.  I feel freer to accept that I just want to paint the beauty of the earth in the way that I feel it.  I embrace the idea that I don't have to go all over the world looking for eye candy. I can see, feel and paint what is right in front of me.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">Disorganized mind, distractions of a new baby dog. Trying to figure out what is important in making art.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Focus and persistence in my classes online - particularly with Fran O'Niel. Is making people happy by giving them art a success?</p>  
<p>Feeling a connection to the long legacy of art - hard to explain, but I feel more connected, also smaller than ever.</p></div>
