<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>I disagree with the word "stuck". It has been great to have the distractions of tasks
outside the home paused and I have felt pretty content staying in. While the stay at home order has been in place since March, I have been working in the studio steadily since I left my last job. I have been underemployed or self-employed for the past year and a half, so there has not been the Zoom meetings and other trappings of trying to work from home.</p>
<p>The adjustment has been in finding a rhythm and balance to the household chores and studio work time and family time. Sometimes that studio time is adjacent to the workout time and breakfast time and does not require a costume change! Cooking new things has become a more communal and creative act and provides the novelty that going out used to, and it feels like learning new things is a productive way to spend time.</p>
<p>While I have been fine with being at home, there is a visual richness that I am missing. I will be glad to get back to some regular day trips or even shopping that provides some novelty and inspiration. I am a sculptor mostly and depend on cast off things and materials for my work. I am steadily working off my back stock of wood, even making projects sized to fit the materials I have. I can mail order some hardware and tools, but it is a deprivation not to just hop out to the hardware store to look at options. Much like the grocery shopping, it is better done in person.</p></div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>I was preparing for a couple of show opportunities this year, so I had a lot going on in the studio. I finished several pieces that were in progress at the time of the shutdown and began others that are in the same vein. At first, it seemed like a temporary slowdown and we would be back up and running in a few months. As the time has past and it appears more and more like our world has changed for the foreseeable future, I will need to rethink the necessity of making every piece I think of. I make things because I must, but not being able to share them in a real space with others would take some of the fun out of it.</p>
<p>Oddly, I had been writing a short story, and this whole plot twist of a pandemic is either in it or not. There will be no avoiding it except by dating the content. I need to decide whether to include this or ignore it and proceed as planned.</p></div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>Too soon to tell. It took me more than a year to absorb 9/11 and even then, what I produced was fairly oblique to the tragedy; more of a response to the response.</p>
<p>I am resisting virus imagery as too facile and obvious, though I have used DNA strands and other "cell" type things in my earlier paintings. But eventually there will be some shorthand that will appear to represent the whole catastrophe.</p>
<p>What I have found is that I am working at a different pace. Because there is no real deadline or known easing of restrictions date, I am not pressured to finish which is sometimes hard for me. There are lots of starts and pauses while things get mulled over and decided before they are completed. I am also trying some different media, because I am feeling a bit crowded by sculpture. I am working on some photography projects and printmaking ideas. The less one makes, the more room there is for conceptual pieces that may exist only on social media. If we are all broadcasting from our bubbles, it could be a new theatrical renaissance in the artworld.</p></div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>I feel exceedingly lucky to be in a position where I have a house and studio, a partner that I love. I have income and I don’t have to telecommute to keep afloat. I am semi-retired with some health challenges but overall, I am not suffering as greatly as some.</p>
<p>The main challenge has been keeping motivated and a positive attitude while the world rages around outside. I have to make stuff in the studio to keep it at bay. People are dying at an alarming rate and there is nothing I can do but stay at home and keep healthy? It seems an inadequate response. However, I have to believe that in the act of creation there is a replacement or replenishment of the spirits that we lose to the virus, conflict or old age. If we survive, and that remains in doubt, we have to live, love and create for the ones who did not fulfil their life’s work.</p></div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>Before the shutdown, I had been examining older work and trying to place it in collections. With the extra time at home, I have begun cataloging more of it and sending out emails with images in the hopes that someone will take an interest. I have several bodies of work that never really got an airing in public and I am hoping to produce a book of some of my photography.</p>
<p>I am not sure if that is a success but reflection on the past is helpful in charting a forward direction. I also have uncovered sketchbooks with some dead ends that I would like to revisit so perhaps there is more change coming to my work. It certainly seems like a great time to take risks and go down a few rabbit holes to see what develops.</p>
<p>Perhaps the success is stopping to think about where we are now and what kind of a world are we stepping into from now on. We are appreciating the things we took for granted, like a crowded concert or art gallery or a dinner party with friends. The isolation we now seek as a safe refuge is becoming a constraint that we are not programmed for. We miss the interactions with other people, known and unknown, who are not wearing masks and who do us the human kindness of acknowledging us.</p>
