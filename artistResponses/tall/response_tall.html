<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>The biggest challenge has been to pay for my studio rent without holding classes and selling work to support it. Also, many of my art exhibitions have been postponed or cancelled, and I miss the camaraderie with other artists, and the opportunity to connect with new collectors. Some of the new work I have done has the idea of protection or shelter from the storm.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>My successes have been anchored in the opportunity to go deeper into subjects that interest me, and to open up new areas of interest and study.</p>
