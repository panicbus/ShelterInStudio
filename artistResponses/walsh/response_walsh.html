<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">Interestingly, it has been positive on many levels. I've had a ton of time to make art, and plenty of inspiration, though not in the ways I thought I would be productive. Plus, I have an affordable studio, which I share only with my partner, so we can easily and safely go there, together or separately. On the other hand my work schedule in "normal" times rotates a month on, a month off, so it doesn't feel as weird as it might for others.</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">I've created several bodies of new work, many which I can't really finish because they are in ceramics. I've also made some linocuts, some sewn works, and I've brought some old works out for a new look. I have come up with lots of project ideas, and am generally inspired.</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">Well, as described above, I'm making a lot of objects for a change. Many of the works have an activist impulse, which is weird for me- not being an activist, but to make objects that are clearly such. I'm crafting things with my hands- that has not been important to me for many years. I'm working in a studio practice way, opposed to a project-based one. I'm allowing immediate impulses to guide me, and feeling very free to experiment. If not now, when?</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">I have little inspiration to make online socially engaged projects. My strength in that regard is being a people person. My challenge with Social Practice has always been with how much time is spent on the computer- so I have not found solace knowing that I might have to go deeper into that hole. I want to be present in real life, with whatever project I do followed by a real hug... . I also have several projects that require online work and that would be easy and fortuitous to do now, but again I am finding it hard to work on the computer too much with the addition of all the zoom meetings. Also, I've been sleeping like crap so my regular schedule and energy levels are irregular, and thus I might not be using my time as efficiently as I am used to. All of my paid work has been cancelled through at least October- that's scary! Oh, and we got kittens. They are distracting.</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">I've been very productive, even if I'm not sure where the work belongs in my overall practice. I've been meeting with another artist every week to discuss professional development work. I feel liberated. I've developed relationships with other artists that I would normally not have time for. My family has been meeting every week, too, and that, along with my senses being open, has led to several ideas. I'm lucky that I qualified for some unemployment and got an emergency grant so I feel so much gratitude that I am not completely screwed financially. And we got kittens. They are adorable.</div>
