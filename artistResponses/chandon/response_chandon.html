<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>What I consider my art practice is two fold. I am a painter and a university professor. When Covid-19 hit and we all were asked to shelter in place my life, the lives of my students, the lives of my gallery owners, and life, as I knew it turned upside down. I quickly needed to educate myself so I could continue teaching remotely and my studio became not only a place to paint but also a place to teach. My spring classes went well all considered and I felt empowered to paint. It seemed to me a great marriage. In the craziness of the outside world my studio felt safe.</p>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>Yes, I have been very productive. I felt I had the time to dig in and get some projects done. Like the world just gave me extra time..</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>Not really. I just fell a bit less stressed like that extra time I gained by not having to drive around was being used wisely.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>Sure, painting is a solitary endeavor and most of the time I love it. I have to say the Zoom classes seeing all of my students and social Zoom meetings have helped fill in some of that isolated feeling</p>
</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <p>Well, like I said, the extra time has enabled me to work faster, more productively and accomplish a lot during this time. I have shipped off one very large commission and several new paintings to my galleries. Worked on the details of a group exhibition that we started a year ago. We are finally going to be installing the work next week? Now it is planning Facebook Live so we can show our work and the narrative of the exhibition, a Zoom meet the artist, and virtual workshop</p>
