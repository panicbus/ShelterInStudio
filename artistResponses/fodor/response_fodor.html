<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">It cancelled all the public events and community art-making workshops I had planned for April and May, related to Earth Day and Climate Justice.  It has me re-examining my role as a community-based artist, and making work, instead, from my own voice and vision more. I have both been working more as an artist independently in the studio, as well as connecting and strengthening my connections with other artists.</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">Yes</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>I've focused more on listening to my own instincts as an artist, rather than "what the community wants", which can get to be an overpowering voice when you work as a community-based artist.</p>
<p>I'm also producing some work focusing on public health, which is a new topic for me.</p></div>

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
<div class="answer">Anxiety and a lack of energy. Feelings of doom and impotence. A complete disappearance of childcare, difficulty sequencing tasks, and operating in an environment in which people (including myself) are both more critical of others and more sensitive to criticism and negativity. Oh -- and I've lost access to my studio, as my husband is now using it as his home office. I have limited visitation rights in my studio (i.e. keep quiet, don't interrupt the zoom call, don't make a mess, and keep our child out).</div>

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>My son and I installed a 5 day temporary mural on Earth Day in a nearby park.  It has lasted about a month. It's a new medium (tempera and clay paint) for me, and I never would have made time for the project if we hadn't been on Shelter-in-Place.</p>
<p>I moved outside my comfort zone by collaborating with musicians to create a the #earthdaysingout, a series of videos from musicians sheltering-in-place about caring for the Earth. These videos reached over 1500 people, creating a sense of unity and community gathering at a time when we cannot gather.</p>
<p>I've been able to use my privilege as an artist with a strong working relationship with a local funder to apply for already-allocated arts funds and release them, though a grant I'm administering, to artists suffering from economic need, through both the #earthdaysingout and another project called "Street Art for Health and Resilience". Putting this money back into the community, in projects that combine economic relief with creating relevant new artwork, has been satisfying. It's also been my first experiments in arts administration, from which I am learning a lot from!</p></div>
