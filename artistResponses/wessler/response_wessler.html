<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>It's given me a good deal of time to organize years' worth of drawings and prints into portfolios. The concrete floor in my garage studio has just been replaced, and I can soon move my etching press back into the space and return to work.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>I have not felt much of a creative spark during this time, though I do find comfort in making the small architectural drawings that I call doodles. I will carve large linocuts from these images, which I was experimenting with before the Shelter in Place order.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">
	<p>My main work will remain the same, which is drawing and printmaking from observation, but I've started collaborating with my 9-year old self. My parents saved lots of my childhood drawings, and now I'm creating collages on canvas using those pictures. I used to draw men's fashion â€“ lots of patterned clothing and sideburns, and also baseball players. It's been a really fun project.</p>
