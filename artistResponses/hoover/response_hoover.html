<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div> 
<div class="answer">It has allowed me to open up in new ways. As life goes on it gets more complex and things get into ruts. So this has been a very interesting forced path out of those ruts. . Of course it's scary and concerning and confusing, but at the same time I"ve had the time to do a whole new thing that I've never done before.</div>

<div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">Yes, I created one event and one new land work. Specifically, I've envisioned a staircase as a performative sculpture. I've seen it in my mind for years and even did some site visits to potential spaces over the years, but nothing ever came of it. Now I'm carving this out of the hillside behind my house and it feels so right. I have also made a new social practice project - a 24-hour dance marathon as a community relief event and a fundraiser, as well as a design for a new food/stories project in my War Gastronomy series.</div> 

<div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
<div class="answer">This earthwork/land artwork is a whole new direction for me.</div> 

<div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div> 
<div class="answer">Learning curve of moving earth and driving rebar.</div> 

<div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div> 
<div class="answer">This has been the most fruitful time for me any my family. With two young children (under 5) in the house, I've seen how much they love and appreciate me around. I bring them joy and pleasure and sustenance. My presence helps them in so many ways I never expected it would. My son has become noticeably gentler and happier and more efflusive with his affection. We are all having an unexpected great time.</div>
