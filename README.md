# Shelter In Studio

A group of California Artists were invited to share their experiences navigating the Covid-19 Crisis and how it affected their studio practice.

The site was created to showcase the stories of the artists and the work they've been doing during the unprecedented time of the 2020 Covid-19 global pandemic. 

It also encourages others to get involved and participate with a submit form.

It is primarily a SPA with lightbox and modal interactions.
