                            <div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I have my printer in my home studio/office, so am able to continue to work while stuck at home.  I am spending even more time than usual in front of a screen, and am sharing my space with both my husband and daughter.  I use my daily walks as a time to get away from screens and be by myself, in addition to getting some exercise, so it seemed a perfect time to make art too.</div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Yes.  I definitely felt that I needed to make work, and wanted to have a daily ritual.  I decided at the start of shelter in place to photograph during my daily walks.  My art is about noticing things, and about beauty, which I brought to this current project.  Each day I photograph what catches my eye as beautiful and then I post it to Instagram the following morning.  I decided early on to make this project a fundraiser for five organizations responding to COVID-19: SF-Marin Food Bank, Meals on Wheels, ACLU, Tipping Point and Safety Net Fund for Bay Area Artists. I feel fortunate that both my husband and I still have our jobs and income, and I wanted to do something to give back to the larger community.  For a $50 donation of more, donors can get an 8.5x11" print from this series.</div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I feel that it has freed me up, and brought me back to my pure love of photography.  Also, I was already thinking in terms of creating work that was site specific, and this project by it’s nature is limited to my neighborhood - about a 20 block radius.  I also am loving having a daily practice - that is something I want to keep even after the shelter in place order is lifted.  I’m also enjoying the challenges of finding new images each day. It’s very spontaneous and immediate.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Time (as always).  I’m still teaching, and moving my classes online was more time consuming in some ways than teaching in person.</div> 

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I have found this to be a generative time for me.  I have made lots of photographs, and so far have raised over $1200 with my fundraiser.  I feel like the art world is being more inclusive and open, which is exciting.  These photos have been in an online exhibition with Borderline Arts Collective, included in an online publication - Quaranzine - and in an online exhibition called Lazy Susan 2 with Blue Arrangements.  I was also inspired by many other photographers (and artists) that I know who were making new work as a result of the shelter in place order.  In some cases they needed to change their way of making work, in others they changed their subject matter.  I saw so much great art on my Instagram feed, that as a curator I felt it would make an interesting exhibition. SF Camerawork features lens-based projects I selected on their Instagram  and website in a series called Quarantine Picture Show, and I will be moderating two dates of artists interviews from this series for them in the upcoming weeks.</div>

                            <div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div> 
                            <div class="answer">It has allowed me to open up in new ways. As life goes on it gets more complex and things get into ruts. So this has been a very interesting forced path out of those ruts. . Of course it's scary and concerning and confusing, but at the same time I"ve had the time to do a whole new thing that I've never done before.</div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Yes, I created one event and one new land work. Specifically, I've envisioned a staircase as a performative sculpture. I've seen it in my mind for years and even did some site visits to potential spaces over the years, but nothing ever came of it. Now I'm carving this out of the hillside behind my house and it feels so right. I have also made a new social practice project - a 24-hour dance marathon as a community relief event and a fundraiser, as well as a design for a new food/stories project in my War Gastronomy series.</div> 

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">This earthwork / land artwork is a whole new direction for me.</div> 

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div> 
                            <div class="answer">Learning curve of moving earth and driving rebar.</div> 

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div> 
                            <div class="answer">This has been the most fruitful time for me any my family. With two young children (under 5) in the house, I've seen how much they love and appreciate me around. I bring them joy and pleasure and sustenance. My presence helps them in so many ways I never expected it would. My son has become noticeably gentler and happier and more efflusive with his affection. We are all having an unexpected great time.</div>

                            <div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div> 
                            <div class="answer">I am fortunate in that my art studio is at my home - the biggest change is that now I am never alone in my house. Pre quarantine, I had arranged my schedule with days where I taught art and days where I made art. And now my schedule is weird and irregular and very much dependent on my daughter and partner being home with me all the time. I spend a lot of time homeschooling and making meals and clearing up.</div>
 
                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">
                            <p>It took me about 3 - 4 weeks into the quarantine to figure out how to make art and if I even wanted to make art. But now I am making small and quick art.</p> 
                            <p>I had two large commissions that came in at the end of January; I finished one in February but I had to ask for an extension from the buyer for the second. I’m finally getting going on it.</p> </div>
                             
                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">
                            <p>My colors have shifted and are intense and brighter than before. I keep using a deep yellow / orange color in my work.</p> 
                            <p>In early 2020, I had joined forces with an artist in North Carolina on a cool social practice collage project called The Collage Stop (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecollagestop/?hl=en" target="_blank">@TheCollageStop</a>). Meredith had solicited paper scrap donations from two collage artists - myself and Holly Cahill in Chicago. We sent our scraps to Meredith who then led a community collage making project in North Carolina. Meredith did a brilliant job facilitating the workshop and reported that there was something really magical for participants to work with our art materials; a lot of cool conversations happened around this project and we were ready to do more. I had the second event scheduled for Richmond in April. Meredith had sent me two bags of scraps just as shelter in place orders were being established. One bag was from Holly (an artist I’ve never met) and one bag was from Meredith (an artist I’ve met once). Opening these bags up and finding the marks, colors, and gestures left by other artists on these papers was the biggest gift. I also had received a set of papers from another artist I’ve never met in Brooklyn, who had sent me scraps from her sketchbooks. And my students had given me scraps they were done with after our last class together in March. I’ve been making a bunch of new work using these gifted and collected papers. I’m using all these bits and pieces from other artists during this time and it feels really good - like a conversation in color, and from a distance. </p></div>
                             
                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I’ve always been good at reinvention and seeing new possibilities. But this is a lot of reinvention. Somedays I am just exhausted. I am not in the studio as much as I used to be. I wonder when we will ever be able to look at art in person, in groups, again. Those first few days and weeks there was so much loss. My spring and summer exhibitions were cancelled. The gallery that represents me closed its doors. I lost all my art teaching jobs and most of my income. Slowly and bit by bit, some teaching opportunities have returned and I’m offering online classes, meeting with students one on one, and making video lessons for kids. It’s not the same at all. I miss teaching and my students and making art in community. I worry about the art centers and galleries and who will be able to survive this.</div>  
                             
                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I am really excited about the super bright art I’m making. When I do have time to get into my studio (literally just sitting down in the room at the end of the house by the back door) I can get something started and then keeping puttering and working on it slowly for days. I like having a piece in progress. I also started making and selling collage kits on my website. I put together a bunch of color sorted painted and found papers, a ready to go art making session.  I’ve mailed them all over the country and sold 30 kits in 2 weeks. I really hope the folks buying these kits feel like they are part of an art making conversation with me.</div>

    						<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer">All-in-all it's been positive (sorry no pun intended.). The shelter-in-place has made it easier for me to focus on making art. </div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">
                            <p>Yes. In fact, I have been super productive and have developed the drawings into a new body of work.</p>  
                            <p>This period coincides with a flow situation that I have been in since the beginning of this year, when I started doing line drawings. It was triggered by a performance that I did in Victoria, British Columbia at the end of last year, for which I did a drawing as meditation on a wall.</p> 
                            <p>Since I came home, I have been doing similar drawings on paper. The quarantine took place soon after that and it kept the distractions away and I have been burying myself in the studio doing these drawings. Since then I have developed it into a series of work based on a simple idea of "Draw A Line And Follow It". I'm still in the midst of that flow, which is really great.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Yes drastically. Prior to this, I had been doing performance predominantly. Now I'm fully occupied doing line drawings.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">
                            <p>The main challenge has been the inability to show works due to the Coronavirus. Several shows have been canceled, including a wall drawing performance in Oregon. On the other hand, because the show was canceled, I decided to do the wall drawing in my own studio and I like what happened.</p> 
                            <p>The other difficulty is that I haven't been able to see friends. The lack of human contact has been hard.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">The undistracted large chunk of time has allowed me not to rush in my work. I have been able to take time to really simmer the works. The rigor and creativity seem to be unusually high. Small breakthroughs happen more often. In fact, after I've experimented with the various drawings on paper, now I'm doing it again on large walls, but with nuances and a new dimension resulted from the experiments on paper.  I'm very happy about that.</div>

							</div>

                            <div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>Initially, the shutdown negatively effected my practice. The disruption of my daily habits lead to a decrease in motivation and drive, and I overestimated how much time I had in each day. Much of my time was spent doing other things and with the amount of extra time I had, I felt as if I had plenty of time to paint, so I didn’t work in the present. After about a month, this passed and I actively decided to dedicate a part of every day to painting.</p> 
                            <p>For several years I have been working through a major transition in my work, especially regarding my emotional relationship with my process, and initially, things didn’t feel any different. I was frustrated and dissatisfied with what I was making. However the shutdown and all of this extra time I had catalyzed an awareness of a thought pattern that was influencing my every move when I was painting: I was always in a hurry. I always needed to be done, not doing, I was always behind. Others were achieving success and I had a lot of catching up to do. I was never fully engaged with my work; my head was always in the future and needed every painting to be done. I needed success. But now with all this extra time, no day job to go to, no deadlines for shows or applications... Why was I still hurrying? What's the rush? It was quite visceral when I had this "aha" moment, I literally had this cathartic wave of euphoria wash over my body and it made me laugh with relief. I realized how these thoughts were always running in the background, and how they had a direct impact on my emotional state while I was creating. I painted for a few hours that night and it felt quite effortless and enjoyable. It helped me get back in touch with the necessary presence, detachment, and playfulness that’s essential for creativity.</p> 
                            <p>I wish I could say that my work has forever changed because of that one moment, but I still find myself going back to my old habits, feeling anxious and rushed. But thankfully I now have an awareness of my state of mind and am actively trying to maintain a healthier relationship with creating.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Yes, I’ve produced about four or five new paintings, and have progressed on many others that were in the works before the lockdown.</div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">It has definitely become looser, more relaxed. My work is abstract, utilizing a lot of gestural paint application and intuitive color choices, and Ive noticed myself being less methodical and uptight about the outcome. I am more engaged with the process and more accepting of failure, which has lead to dramatically different results.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">My biggest challenge has been letting go of the outcome. My old mental habits still need every painting, every mark, to be right. Every piece needs to be better than everything I've done before... Which is just another aspect of the destructive emotional habits and egoic desires that have ultimately been hindering my progress. So while it's not related directly to the lockdown, it's what I've been wrestling with. Im fortunate enough to have financial stability, a home studio, and ample supplies to create, so my challenges have been mostly internal.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">My work has taken a turn because of my new and developing awareness, which has definitely been my greatest success.</div>

							<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>I disagree with the word "stuck". It has been great to have the distractions of tasks
                            outside the home paused and I have felt pretty content staying in. While the stay at home order has been in place since March, I have been working in the studio steadily since I left my last job. I have been underemployed or self-employed for the past year and a half, so there has not been the Zoom meetings and other trappings of trying to work from home.</p>
                            <p>The adjustment has been in finding a rhythm and balance to the household chores and studio work time and family time. Sometimes that studio time is adjacent to the workout time and breakfast time and does not require a costume change! Cooking new things has become a more communal and creative act and provides the novelty that going out used to, and it feels like learning new things is a productive way to spend time.</p>
                            <p>While I have been fine with being at home, there is a visual richness that I am missing. I will be glad to get back to some regular day trips or even shopping that provides some novelty and inspiration. I am a sculptor mostly and depend on cast off things and materials for my work. I am steadily working off my back stock of wood, even making projects sized to fit the materials I have. I can mail order some hardware and tools, but it is a deprivation not to just hop out to the hardware store to look at options. Much like the grocery shopping, it is better done in person.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>I was preparing for a couple of show opportunities this year, so I had a lot going on in the studio. I finished several pieces that were in progress at the time of the shutdown and began others that are in the same vein. At first, it seemed like a temporary slowdown and we would be back up and running in a few months. As the time has past and it appears more and more like our world has changed for the foreseeable future, I will need to rethink the necessity of making every piece I think of. I make things because I must, but not being able to share them in a real space with others would take some of the fun out of it.</p>
                            <p>Oddly, I had been writing a short story, and this whole plot twist of a pandemic is either in it or not. There will be no avoiding it except by dating the content. I need to decide whether to include this or ignore it and proceed as planned.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>Too soon to tell. It took me more than a year to absorb 9/11 and even then, what I produced was fairly oblique to the tragedy; more of a response to the response.</p>
                            <p>I am resisting virus imagery as too facile and obvious, though I have used DNA strands and other "cell" type things in my earlier paintings. But eventually there will be some shorthand that will appear to represent the whole catastrophe.</p>
                            <p>What I have found is that I am working at a different pace. Because there is no real deadline or known easing of restrictions date, I am not pressured to finish which is sometimes hard for me. There are lots of starts and pauses while things get mulled over and decided before they are completed. I am also trying some different media, because I am feeling a bit crowded by sculpture. I am working on some photography projects and printmaking ideas. The less one makes, the more room there is for conceptual pieces that may exist only on social media. If we are all broadcasting from our bubbles, it could be a new theatrical renaissance in the artworld.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>I feel exceedingly lucky to be in a position where I have a house and studio, a partner that I love. I have income and I don’t have to telecommute to keep afloat. I am semi-retired with some health challenges but overall, I am not suffering as greatly as some.</p>
                            <p>The main challenge has been keeping motivated and a positive attitude while the world rages around outside. I have to make stuff in the studio to keep it at bay. People are dying at an alarming rate and there is nothing I can do but stay at home and keep healthy? It seems an inadequate response. However, I have to believe that in the act of creation there is a replacement or replenishment of the spirits that we lose to the virus, conflict or old age. If we survive, and that remains in doubt, we have to live, love and create for the ones who did not fulfil their life’s work.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>Before the shutdown, I had been examining older work and trying to place it in collections. With the extra time at home, I have begun cataloging more of it and sending out emails with images in the hopes that someone will take an interest. I have several bodies of work that never really got an airing in public and I am hoping to produce a book of some of my photography.</p>
                            <p>I am not sure if that is a success but reflection on the past is helpful in charting a forward direction. I also have uncovered sketchbooks with some dead ends that I would like to revisit so perhaps there is more change coming to my work. It certainly seems like a great time to take risks and go down a few rabbit holes to see what develops.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps the success is stopping to think about where we are now and what kind of a world are we stepping into from now on. We are appreciating the things we took for granted, like a crowded concert or art gallery or a dinner party with friends. The isolation we now seek as a safe refuge is becoming a constraint that we are not programmed for. We miss the interactions with other people, known and unknown, who are not wearing masks and who do us the human kindness of acknowledging us.</p>

							<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Interestingly, it has been positive on many levels. I've had a ton of time to make art, and plenty of inspiration, though not in the ways I thought I would be productive. Plus, I have an affordable studio, which I share only with my partner, so we can easily and safely go there, together or separately. On the other hand my work schedule in "normal" times rotates a month on, a month off, so it doesn't feel as weird as it might for others.</div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I've created several bodies of new work, many which I can't really finish because they are in ceramics. I've also made some linocuts, some sewn works, and I've brought some old works out for a new look. I have come up with lots of project ideas, and am generally inspired.</div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Well, as described above, I'm making a lot of objects for a change. Many of the works have an activist impulse, which is weird for me- not being an activist, but to make objects that are clearly such. I'm crafting things with my hands- that has not been important to me for many years. I'm working in a studio practice way, opposed to a project-based one. I'm allowing immediate impulses to guide me, and feeling very free to experiment. If not now, when?</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I have little inspiration to make online socially engaged projects. My strength in that regard is being a people person. My challenge with Social Practice has always been with how much time is spent on the computer- so I have not found solace knowing that I might have to go deeper into that hole. I want to be present in real life, with whatever project I do followed by a real hug... . I also have several projects that require online work and that would be easy and fortuitous to do now, but again I am finding it hard to work on the computer too much with the addition of all the zoom meetings. Also, I've been sleeping like crap so my regular schedule and energy levels are irregular, and thus I might not be using my time as efficiently as I am used to. All of my paid work has been cancelled through at least October- that's scary! Oh, and we got kittens. They are distracting.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I've been very productive, even if I'm not sure where the work belongs in my overall practice. I've been meeting with another artist every week to discuss professional development work. I feel liberated. I've developed relationships with other artists that I would normally not have time for. My family has been meeting every week, too, and that, along with my senses being open, has led to several ideas. I'm lucky that I qualified for some unemployment and got an emergency grant so I feel so much gratitude that I am not completely screwed financially. And we got kittens. They are adorable.</div>

							</div>
							<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>I’m the mother of an eight-year-old and a one-year-old. I was the primary caregiver for both girls prior to quarantine,and worked part time for Sacramento State as a photography professor thanks to a collage of childcare from three different providers. My eight-year-old is in second grade at our local school. Now I am trying to homeschool my second grader and provide all the care for my baby, except for one day a week when we have retained one of our babysitters for a few hours. He lives alone and is a very responsible quarantin-er, and he’s working on his PhD, so he’s able to control how many people he sees. We’re essentially quarantining together with him. So I have almost no time where I can reliably work. The six hours a week I get on Fridays go toward a little exercise, some more focused time with my older daughter—because she’s really been struggling with all the changes in her life, and the loss of school and her teachers and her friends—and sometimes some house projects that I can’t do with the baby, grocery shopping, or a phone call to a friend, or a little bit of time drawing, painting and taking classes in watercolor and drawing.</p>
                            <p>I’m a social practice artist, and a photographer, so I’m not usually a mark maker. Even before quarantine, I had been feeling a strong urge to make work in a new or different way than I have in the past ten years or so. I came to the end of a series of projects that were all very similar, and it was a really positive, exciting end, and I wanted to take time after that to think about how I would embark on my next longer-term project, and how to really make sure the micro-level of making was different in it, as well as the theme and the overall structure. So now that I can’t put serious chunks of time into anything professional, it has felt great to try to learn some new skills by taking online classes—informally, through CreativeBug—and to go back to the kinds of playful making I used to do as a kid and a young adult. Basically, I’m treating art as a hobby at the moment, instead of as a profession, and that’s really fun and both novel and comforting. Although it’s very temporary—very much tied to this time where my baby can’t be left alone and I’m constantly on call for her. It’s also the sort of fallow period between big projects, where you start to gather yourself for the next one, both intellectually and energetically.</p>
                            <p>I’ve read lots of articles where parents describe their heroic patterns of working at night after their children are asleep... that’s just not a reality for me. I am not a night person—I get to about 7 pm after a full day of interacting with my kids and I can barely make a sentence anymore, let alone do complex intellectual, emotional or physical work. I always see art as the highest possible form of intellectual pursuit—not that it’s higher than other things, but that it’s equal to other things that we would think of conventionally as the height of complexity and skill. That doesn’t mean that every practitioner reaches the highest expression of the form, but I always want to be working toward that as a goal. So that’s not something I want to tackle while brain-dead. And I feel pretty silly noodling around with watercolor and when I have no real skills in that department, and definitely no complexity or subtlety. But I also believe in finding ways to make yourself happy, following intuition, and trying to preserve mental health as both a person in quarantine and as a parent, so I’m trying to stifle the judgement and just allow myself to have fun. Learning this kind of skill and doing small works on paper are also things I can be interrupted in and still come back to without losing my place, so to speak. So they are really fitting in with my current limitations. And I can these things with my older daughter, which feels great and helps me support her learning.</p>
                            <p>I miss working a lot. I definitely worry about my professional momentum, and have moments where I wonder what’s going to emerge from this time. I am certainly not immune to existential professional doubt. (And fear and anxiety in general.) But those things pale in comparison to my awareness of the extreme privilege I am speaking from. I have had—and continue to have—so many choices in both my personal and professional life, and so much support from my family. Nothing about my concerns compares to the job insecurity, food insecurity, home insecurity, and health insecurity that most people are dealing with in one way or another right now. My biggest day to day worry is keeping my mental health good, so that I can be a good mom and support my girls appropriately as we all get through this. I think everyone is having to work hard to find mental and emotional and physical health right now—some people amidst extreme adversity. And any one of us could be on the brink of seeing our lives turned upside down, or even end abruptly.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>I have an ongoing practice of photographing my children in nature, and during certain moments of their childhoods that say something about my parenting, their environment, or their personalities. That’s something I developed when I was first home with my older daughter, when she was a baby. So that’s seamlessly woven into my daily life and I am always making new work to a certain extent through that modality. Though it has a very limited scope and audience—I just post those pictures to a private Instagram account.</p>
                            <p>I’m also constantly researching. I’m thinking about a new project now, so I’m looking at things interest me that could tie into it, and learning about other artists, ideas and resources that could help me once I really begin the work.</p>
                            <p>I’ve also been making these small works on paper, mostly in the form of cards I send to friends and family. I’ve toyed with the idea of making them printable, so that I could release them to a wider audience, but I haven’t moved ahead with that yet.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I have found myself trying to adapt some of the intellectual ways that I approach my work to my parenting more overtly recently. I always think about parenting creatively, and try to bring some of the same intentionality to my life that I bring to my work, but I think now that I am kind of trapped in my personal life without ANY professional life, I’m trying to do that even more, and help myself be even more aware of it, so that I can find more joy in what I am doing. Every few weeks I feel myself hit a wall and I try to recommit to enjoying my daughters and this kind of relentless time with them. Interestingly, it’s really not that different from what I wanted for myself anyway, while my baby is a baby (I love babies!) but removing just those few extra hours of time where I could work each week has affected my happiness a lot. I was also teaching last term, and I’m not this term, and that’s very different. I love the intellectual and social gymnastics of teaching, and I miss my students and my colleagues. Though I don’t know how I’d be managing to continue teaching remotely while caring for a maniacal baby, so I think I lucked out there overall.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Learning, and wanting to learn. Making small works, even if they are silly and decorative, with zero depth, nuance or skill. ;) Cooking beautiful meals for my family. Helping my daughters learn at home (and only at home.) Feeling in love with my partner, and appreciating all that he does for our family. Feeling good about myself as a mom, neighbor, colleague, friend, daughter, sister and wife.</div>

							<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer">The hardest impact has been on my responsibilities outside of my art practice. With two young children, an in person ceramics teaching job, and online art history classes it has been difficult to transition to being at home full time. I also have not had access to my usual studio or certain materials. I had a show planned for October, but the gallery has dropped off the map and are not answering my emails and calls. I am however still working on things.</div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Since the limitations have hindered what I was planning on doing, I have taken to a deep experimental process. I have built a wood kiln in my backyard and am currently exploring what that will lead to. I have no idea if it will all come together into something that fits with my usual body of work, but I really don't care at the moment.</div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I've been interested in the same types of things for sometime now, but I am feeling more of a draw towards these ideas. I'm obsessed with human history, ingenuity, and accessing the past to make sense of the future. I think this mode of thinking has served me well in the past and is helping me get through the present.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">My challenges have been mostly domestic. Making sure one kid is engaging with school work while the other is also growing and learning. Breaking up fights over who gets what cup, toy, or whatever. Getting the kids to not go into the apartment downstairs where my mother in law who doesn't believe in the pandemic lives. Going to the grocery store all suited up and then stripping down, showering, then wiping each item with alcohol. Dealing with the overwhelming stress in my daily thoughts, reactions, and in my body where it manifests into intense muscular pain. All the while trying to come up with some idea that will make people think and feel, plus finding the time to make it.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">When I was 14 I grew 6 inches over the summer. I had severe "growing pains" and cramps in my legs, but by September I was as taller and stronger. I feel like that now. I hear the divine mysterious voice that tells artists what to do and it's quite loud. I feel myself becoming more something, I'm just not sure what it is. If I had more time and/or money I would be producing a shit ton of work, but that's always the case. I am however working with what I've got, exploring, and discovering.</div>

                            <div class="answer">Although I hesitate to go to my remote art studio in San Pablo, I stay at home in Albany and work on my home studio. I have more time to concentrate on my art since I save commute time for the studio and places to teach classes.</div>

							<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer">At the beginning of the shelter in place mandate I began applying for more grants for projects and was able to take care of a lot of long-over-due edits to my website. But the weight of the pandemic and impact on friends and family began to influence my ability to concentrate on my practice at all. I don't feel motivated to read any theory books that I've been meaning to read or write any critical essays I've been meaning to write. I feel like I'm stagnating, but I keep reminding myself that it is ok not to produce right now and I'm looking towards projects that are more community-focused.</div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">
                            <p>Yes, I co-founded a virtual studio visit project that uses community raised funds to pay artists and arts organizers who have been financially impacted by COVID-19. The project is called TBD Salon. We partner with arts non profits to help us raise funds for each studio visit and work with artists and arts organizers across the country. You can find out more info here: <a href="https://tbdsalon.cargo.site/" target="_blank">https://tbdsalon.cargo.site/</a>.</p>
                            <p>I've also begun working on a staff art show for SFMOMA staff members. It will be online and we are looking into staff members being able to sell their work listed on a separate website from the museum website. It will include SFMOMA staff who have been laid off; it's still in progress and has not launched. But, we are hoping to instill a sense of community and support through this effort.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">
                            <p>Yes, one exhibition I was curating was postponed to an undetermined time frame. The exhibition was to open at the Knockdown Center in New York in June 2020. Given the location and the unpredictability of the virus right now, the staff at the Knockdown are unable to provide a new opening date for the show, which I completely understand. I'm just happy that they haven't cancelled the show entirely. The decision made me hold off from working any more on the exhibition like shipping artworks, loan agreements, or exhibition layout details. </p>

                            <p>I was also invited to my first writing group. It has allowed me to explore more creative forms of writing and find an outlet for all of what I'm experiencing right now with a supportive group of friends. It feels good to provide feedback for their work and see them grow.</p> 
                            </div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">
                            <p>My mother was diagnosed with 4th stage pancreatic cancer about 3 weeks into the shelter in place mandate. The reality for her extended family and friends to see her has been incredibly difficult because we don't want the virus to spread, but also want her closest people to say their goodbyes. For me, I'm trying to dig myself out of a dark place with the news of her illness as well as the bleak outlook of the future in the coming year or years due to the pandemic. I have been full time care taking and it has limited the time and emotions I am able to put into the projects I mentioned above.</p>

                            <p>I'm also in an uncertain time with my employment at SFMOMA. It was just announced that the museum will be making another round of staff layoffs, and I am unsure where I stand in those decisions. I won't know until next week. I feel like I've worked really hard to get to the position I'm in and will feel pretty lost in regards to next steps if I am laid off. The decision by the museum has also left the staff feeling really disappointed and the morale is really low. Beyond the staff art show, I am struggling to find ways to support my colleagues while also preserving my mental health amongst my sadness with my mother's illness.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">
                            <p>I've been asking my mother to tell me about her life, in short segments, and I record the conversations. I'm not sure what I'll do with all the content, but perhaps it can find a way into my curatorial practice. It seems to give me hope that I have these recordings.</p>

                            <p>For TBD Salon, many people and organizations who we have reached out to have said "yes" to working with us. It's an incredible feeling to know that folks see this project as worthwhile and want to grow it with us. It has also been a way for me to reconnect with people who in turn have supported me emotionally through this tough period with my mother's illness. It has been an incredible support system. At this point in time we have raised $975 for artists and arts organizers! I'm so enlivened by my community and desire to continue to connect.</p>

                            <div class="answer">It cancelled all the public events and community art-making workshops I had planned for April and May, related to Earth Day and Climate Justice.  It has me re-examining my role as a community-based artist, and making work, instead, from my own voice and vision more. I have both been working more as an artist independently in the studio, as well as connecting and strengthening my connections with other artists.</div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>

                            <p>I've focused more on listening to my own instincts as an artist, rather than "what the community wants", which can get to be an overpowering voice when you work as a community-based artist.</p>
                            <p>I'm also producing some work focusing on public health, which is a new topic for me.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Anxiety and a lack of energy. Feelings of doom and impotence. A complete disappearance of childcare, difficulty sequencing tasks, and operating in an environment in which people (including myself) are both more critical of others and more sensitive to criticism and negativity. Oh -- and I've lost access to my studio, as my husband is now using it as his home office. I have limited visitation rights in my studio (i.e. keep quiet, don't interrupt the zoom call, don't make a mess, and keep our child out).</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>My son and I installed a 5 day temporary mural on Earth Day in a nearby park.  It has lasted about a month. It's a new medium (tempera and clay paint) for me, and I never would have made time for the project if we hadn't been on Shelter-in-Place.</p>
                            <p>I moved outside my comfort zone by collaborating with musicians to create a the #earthdaysingout, a series of videos from musicians sheltering-in-place about caring for the Earth. These videos reached over 1500 people, creating a sense of unity and community gathering at a time when we cannot gather.</p>
                            <p>I've been able to use my privilege as an artist with a strong working relationship with a local funder to apply for already-allocated arts funds and release them, though a grant I'm administering, to artists suffering from economic need, through both the #earthdaysingout and another project called "Street Art for Health and Resilience". Putting this money back into the community, in projects that combine economic relief with creating relevant new artwork, has been satisfying. It's also been my first experiments in arts administration, from which I am learning a lot from!</p></div>

                            <div class="answer"><p>I stopped painting for 6 weeks. I sat on the back porch and stared at the garden. I got a dog and poured loved into it. I recognized the inconsequential nature of my work. I had always longed for a period of time like this to work, but when it came, I couldn't do anything.  Now I am getting back to it. I have signed on to some great workshops and that has given me entry back into the studio. I feel like I am going to be doing something new and different. I am trying to get back to the rich and joyful experience of painting now. I am working in a structured way like I am a student. </p> 
                            <p>I started giving paintings away via social media. </p>
                            <p>I have watched a lot of Art 21 and Louisiana TV art interviews.</p>
                            <p>I have looked at a lot of my old work and feel strong affection for it... it's BC - before covid. Hopes, paths and pursuits were so different then.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Yes. I have been painting on 22 x 30 300 pound paper. Landscapes. Abstractions. I am painting clouds small in oil.  
                            
                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I am not so interested in what I used to do. I am leaning in to a new direction and until I get there I am doing exercises from the classes I am taking - finding them very rich!  My mind is open to learn now.  I feel freer to accept that I just want to paint the beauty of the earth in the way that I feel it.  I embrace the idea that I don't have to go all over the world looking for eye candy. I can see, feel and paint what is right in front of me.</div>

                            <p>Feeling a connection to the long legacy of art - hard to explain, but I feel more connected, also smaller than ever.</p></div>

							<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer">My daily routine has not changed much. I have been self-employed for a couple of years now and I am used to having a flexible schedule. I have been spending a lot of time in the studio, since there are less work related activities I want to take advantage of having all this extra time making art. I have been preoccupied with a few personal projects lately and I am taking part in some really interesting collective projects also. Emotionally, I am experiencing a lot of the collective anxiety and grief, and being productive in the studio feels like a wonderful distraction right now.</div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Yes. I am working on a few series that involve handmade view cameras, vanitas inspired photographs, a lot of electronic waste and drawings.</div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">My current project involves making stereo view cameras and using them as "visual mediation devices" to produce digital images. I began this project in early March, so in a way the work is evolving along with the Covid-19 outbreak. This pandemic has made me realise the degree I have become dependent on the media. From the daily news to all the Zoom interactions, social media and the emergence of many collective projects, the media is my means for communication, yet I am also aware that it is being used for spreading misinformation and censorship. I am thinking about the media as both a channel and a barrier and I have been trying to explore that in my work.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I am in a privileged position right now where I can spend a lot of time in the studio and focus on making art. I have a lot of anxiety with the uncertainty of freelance work, although I am still maintaining some of the remote work that I do, such as printing, and I am figuring out virtual ways to offer more services through teaching online. Also, I’m struggling a bit with the fact that I have families overseas and knowing I can't travel and visit in the foreseeable future.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Personally, being overly ambitious seems to not work in the current environment. I enjoy being productive in the studio and making art brings me joy. When it comes to the mundane part of life, if I manage a day answering emails, keeping the house in order, having exercised, I see these little victories as a success.</div>

							</div>
							<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I feel very lucky that my practice is multi-disciplinary; I am able to shift my focus in order to meet space requirements. While at home I have been embroidering, and occasionally making small gouache paintings. I lost both of my jobs at the start of the pandemic, so I’ve started to make commissioned work as well. I've always been someone with hyper focus (making one piece at a time), but in order to give myself more of a schedule I'm splitting up my day between multiple projects. That has been the toughest aspect of the transition for me.</div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">
                                <p>I’ve produced a surprisingly large amount of work so far. The commissions are embroidered patches based on images from art history. I seriously started embroidering about a year ago, so there is still a lot for me to learn about my relationship to the techniques. I’m making about 3 patches a week, so this project has been a good means for me to quickly improve and extend my skills in the medium. Also, it’s always a pleasure to return to art history.</p>
                                <p>In my own practice, I've been doing a lot of research into psychoanalysis and finishing up a new body of work. I’ve been working on a series of embroidered tapestries called "Once There Was, Once There Wasn't", focusing on the labor of healing mechanisms and the persistence of trauma. I'm looking forward to seeing all the work together, but also to start the next endeavor—-I feel new ideas bubbling. </p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Aesthetically, I don't think there have been any major changes. However, since I am so close to concluding this series I’ve been doing quite a bit of writing and reflection. I want to make sure that the way I tie everything together tells an interesting story overall. I haven't had time to spend with my nose in books since grad school, so it's been clarifying to return to text and I feel revitalized in my conceptual goals.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">As I mentioned earlier, balancing my time between my projects has been the most difficult part of my at home studio practice. Time is acting so funny right now, simultaneously like molasses and oil—sticky, slow, and fast. The endless hours of reality television I consume while embroidering don't add any clarity to my sense of time either. I've been testing out different schedules but haven't found the right fit yet. It's certainly frustrating feeling like I'm spending time working on how to work, but I am confident the time I'm putting in will pay off.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I think I have had many successes. Most significantly that I feel like I'm finally starting to wrap my head around Lacanian theory, and that I've continued to make work.</div>

							<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I am a student in an MFA program. On campus, I have the largest studio I've worked in so far. It's filled with gorgeous light and I am surrounded by magic, creative people. My home studio is a large closet with a built in desk, and a cute little window. I guess you could say that I have downsized my studio, but I have expanded my art practice into my apartment.</div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">During this time of sheltering-in-place I have created an unexpected amount of new work. I have found that the extra time of not commuting gives me time to read and think, which helps fuel my creating practice. Additionally, I feel like I have found new materials to work with. I am using what I had reserved for costumes and decorations to make artwork. It's been a playful process.</div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">This time at home has freed me to make my work more personal. Before I was working with certain themes and alluding to specifics. I am still working within the same themes but since I am incorporating my personal objects my work has become more about my live experiences. </div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I have not been able to make messes, and that has been a challenge. It is more difficult to get lost in creating when I need to be aware of where paint or glue might drop. I am also feeling the loss of social interactions around art. Not being able to drop into someone's studio and have a conversation is a missed interaction.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I have continued my installation practice through developing apartment interventions. Apartment interventions are installations that we have to interact with in order to proceed with our day. They disrupt doorways and block the use of drawers. These interventions often reflect how it feels to be outside interacting with the world right now. I've also had to improve my documentation of my work because no one will ever see the installations I am creating here in person. Additionally, through a dream I found new drawing subject matter.</div>

							<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer">My studio closed at the start of Covid-19. Luckily I was able to sometimes make work out of my teaching studio nearby. I am not working the long days( 7-10 hours) I am used to because I am not mentally able to at this time. I have set up a makeshift studio in my backyard.  My attention span has been greatly affected by the pandemic, I get tired at around 5 and need to rest and call it a day. </div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">
                            <p>In my practice, I am always making new work as experimentation is part of my process.</p>
                            <p>I took an online workshop with Giselle Hicks to learn more about coil building. Coil building is the meditative process of pinching clay to build up, you can spend hours pinching, I find soothing repetition to be a very useful technique during this hard time. To alleviate anxiety I have started pinching large shallow bowls which I find very calming.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">When you work in an unpredictable medium like clay, there are a lot failures. I have started to look at these failures and explore how to appreciate them. What are they telling me when I stop looking for perfection.</div>

                            <div class="answer"> 
                            <p>A big challenge has been imagining what the future will look like and how that is affecting my daily life. Before I always was working towards a goal, now I have less things to look forward to. I am fortunate to have my partner working from home but we are not sure how long this will last. So much is unknown.</p>
                            <p>Another big challenge has been seeing the effects of this virus on my community. Every person I see has a scared stricken look that gives their face a sallow palor. I am  seeing people's health effected by sadness and it makes me sad. I see the same effects in the mirror.</p></div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I have seen success in this new climate selling work online, getting accepted into online group sales. I feel that every day I don't cry is a successful day.</div>

							<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer">My studio has been moved into my kitchen. I've constructed a standing desk above the kitchen sink. Behind me is a wall to pin ideas to. It took weeks to settle into a working process, but what seems to work for me is coffee and fiction reading (Jamel Brinkley’s "A Lucky Man", Lorrie Moore "Self Help" ...oh! and Ottessa Moshfegh's "My Year of Rest and Relaxation"—a great book but way too on the nose to read while in quarantine). Generative artmaking or writing. Lunch. Lazy afternoon or research. Dinner. Drawing while watching docuseries.</div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I've certainly tried. I have started a couple different drawing series that I'm still not sure if they are working. I've made a lot of progress on a long term project that involves reacting to some slow-growing plants. I would say the most progress is that I feel like I have a deeper understanding of what my work needs.</div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Dramatically. I make sculpture and performance and social practice, all of which rely on public spaces, access to parks and the outdoors, and other people. Place and environment are some of my biggest inspirations—when the shelter in place order was announced, I was just getting into rigging my camera with an underwater case so I could study mussels growing in the Alameda estuary. Now I'm primarily studying bivalves through reading. Did you know the city of Warsaw has eight living clams rigged with switches that tell the city when the water supply is contaminated? They look, structurally speaking, exactly like my sculptures. I'm not sure if I would have come across these little guys had I not been spending hours and hours on the internet and on the phone with my art friends, one of whom sent me a link to the documentary about the clams ("Fat Kathy" just debuted yesterday).</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">The most interesting thing that has happened is in my long term project, which is to try to discover if a plant that moves with sunlight (called "nyctinastic" movement) could be consulted to set camera exposure. I've constructed five of these biohacker lightmeters and have been growing different nyctinastic plants in each since December. I had pretty much abandoned four, but the fifth, mimosa pudica, though growing the slowest was making the most reliable movement between day and night. I set up a <a href="https://www.sustainedbyvisions.com/wfs/lightmeter" target="_blank">timelapse</a> video to capture its movement. Ten hours into the timelapse my cat devoured the plant whole. All that was left was a little twiggy stem. I had set out to try to establish an interspecies relationship—I would provide the plant with ideal growing conditions, and it would tell me about the sun. I didn't count on a third species and her desires and needs.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I'm really excited about the amount of research I've been able to do and how that will inform what I make when I have more space and my shop at my disposal. I went down a rabbit hole looking at the history of mimosa pudica in scientific literature. It turns out to have inspired the first description of circadian rhythm, written in France by Jacques de Mairan, and continues to be a plant that is used for research on plant memory and communication. I discovered through de Mairan that a Swedish botanist, Carl Linnaeus, hypothesized a clock that relies on flowers that open at different hours of the morning. When you find that a rope you’ve been pulling is attached to a whole system that was previously unseen is so rewarding.</div>

							<div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Luckily, I have great roommates and I also have access to my studio. It's definitely been an anxious time but I'm grateful to still be in the studio. </div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer"> Yeah I've been creating a lot. Working mainly on two different bodies of work right now.</div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Yeah but my work is always changing. I revisited some older styles in order to paint at home early on in quarantine. The work has been influenced by internal and external dialogues so as conversations change, environments often follow.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Being around friends and community. I love hosting friends at the studio and often work while in conversation so I miss that. Navigating upcoming shows and projects that have been postponed or canceled has been a source of anxiety. Access to materials has also been a little bit of a challenge.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer"> Staying focused and inspired</div>

                                <img class="meta__avatar" src="img/authors/default.jpeg" alt="author08" />
                            </div>
                            <div class="question">How has being stuck at home affected your art practice?</div>
                            <div class="answer">My practice before graduate school was almost entirely digital. When I got to the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) in 2018, I ended up going in what seemed to be the opposite direction. My practice evolved into being very hands-on, where I experimented with MDF, caution tape and concrete for example. Since being stuck at home, I have been pushing myself to experiment more in a digital way. Videos and sound pieces have become a large part of my studio practice, along with digital drawings and incorporating objects that I find around my house with my printed photographic images. On the flip side of that, I have been taking a lot of photographs on my daily walks around my neighborhood. I feel like I am letting myself make anything and everything I want to, just because I want to, and that feeling has been really exciting.</div>

                            <div class="question">Have you created new work during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I have been able to continue to make something new on a weekly basis. Some days I get in the zone and work for five or six hours straight, while other days I take more time to relax and just think. I am very fortunate that I am able to create new works on the computer, and I have been working with my photo archive. Making work grounds me, and it motivates me, which is especially important during this transition phase of my life. I just graduated with my MFA during a global pandemic, the art world as we know it is in a state of metamorphosis, and I moved back in with my parents among other things. I have no idea what the future holds, but making art helps me process. I feel a certain peace being back at home though, maybe it's because I have taken up gardening or don't have to worry about paying rent.</div>

                            <div class="question">Has your work changed in any way during this period?</div>
                            <div class="answer">My work has definitely shifted during this time. Since I don't have access to a woodshop, or a separate studio space, and since I have moved back in with my parents for the foreseeable future, I have had to make big changes in the way I approach my process. I have embraced the digital component of my practice. I have begun to make video and sound pieces that explore my relationship to my new, yet familiar surrounding of my childhood home in San Jose, California, as well as mixed media prints on dibond or aluminum that incorporate digital drawings I've done and found objects from around the house. I've also been installing the work all throughout my parent's house which has been a lot of fun.</div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your challenges been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">The biggest challenge I am currently facing is the absence of my San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) community. I graduated with my MFA just a few weeks ago (May 2020), and it has been an interesting two years. I feel grateful for the experiences that I had while in school, and truthfully, I am completely honored to have been able to share that space with my classmates, friends, and to have learned from some really incredible people and artists. I'm already feeling nostalgic. It truly is a special place. In the face of the unthinkable, the school’s possible closure, it was nothing short of inspirational to see our community come together. While it took me a year or so to really understand what was going on, I have realized since being stuck at home, that SFAI taught me two of the most cliche, yet beautiful lessons that I needed to learn in regards to art, which is impermanence and experimentation. As alum Nao Bustamante so boldly advised in our commencement ceremony, "Follow the love", and I couldn’t agree more. </div>

                            <div class="question">What have some of your successes been?</div>
                            <div class="answer">I think the biggest success I've had thus far is that I have overcome not taking my creative process so seriously. I have shed previous expectations that I had for myself, and I really feel like I am at a place where more and more of myself is coming through in the work. Being away from my usual facilities has really challenged me to experiment in ways I wouldn't have if I still had access to my school studio. I would say, my biggest success has been learning how to let go of my own expectations of what art can/should be, and to really embrace and enjoy the process of making, because that's what I love to do.</div>

                <h2>Stay In Studio Project</h2>
                <p>Due to Covid-19 the world has been put on pause. We are all sheltered in place and responding to an ever evolving situation. In this climate of collective anxiety and uncertainty I have been trying to focus on keeping an active studio practice and developing a new body of work. It has been stressful and nerve-wracking at times but also intensely enlightening and gratifying. When will I ever again have endless hours to develop new concepts, go down new rabbit holes and take risks in my work I might not normally take.</p>

                <p>As a Social Practice artist I am curious how other artists are coping with this situation and have created a project called "Stay In Studio". My goal is to reach out to 100 California Artists and ask them the questions below. Responses can be as deep or brief as you like, its your choice.</p> 

                <p>These responses will live on a website I'm designing that will be updated as new participants come in. It is my hope that this content will turn into a published book and I am in the process of applying for several grants to help make this possible.</p>

                <p>When these terrible times pass we can look back at a collective document of how hard working, resilient and adaptive California Artists were in response to a really tough situation.</p>
