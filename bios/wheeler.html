    <p>Bay Area artist Erin McCluskey Wheeler has a BA in studio art and art history from Beloit College, and an MFA from California College of the Arts. Erin work’s in paper (found, painted, printed, and cut) to create abstract graphic collage art. In her work, Erin associates landscapes and colors with people in her life and while the work is abstract and open ended, it comes from a place of personal symbolism and meaning. Erin teaches collage and mixed media classes and workshops throughout the Bay Area (and now virtually) and in 2018-2019, she was the Artist in Residence for the El Cerrito Recycling Center. Erin’s artwork is licensed and sold through West Elm, Samsung, and Minted.
