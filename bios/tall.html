  	<h2>Artist Bio</h2>
  	<p>Cheryl Tall is a Southern California-based artist whose work focuses on the relationships between people and their environment, and often includes architectural, narrative and figurative elements in her work. She is especially known for her pinch coil technique, which gives her work an unusual texture reminiscent of wood shingles or scales.</p>

		<p>Tall has always lived in coastal towns, and derives her color palate from tropical vegetation, houses and landscapes. She has traveled extensively and has been inspired by arts in Canada, Japan, China, Greece, France, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Korea, Mexico, and the U.S. An early childhood steeped in fantasy, due to family involvement at Disney World, has given her work sense of animation and theater.</p> 

		<p>Tall earned a BFA in Art from the University of Central Florida and an MFA from the University of Miami, FL, where she studied ceramics with Christine Federighi, and also studied fine art and medieval history. Her work is included in 24 books, and in numerous museum collections, corporate and private collections.</p>
