    <p>Collin Pollard is a visual artist currently living and working between San Francisco and San Jose, California. Pollard completed his undergraduate degree in art history and communication design before pursuing his MFA in studio art from the San Francisco Art Institute. As an artist who primarily works in photography, sculpture, and new media, his interests lie in experimenting with new methods of installation to challenge the viewer on how a photograph can be experienced.</p> 

    <p>Pollard's practice is interested in our built environments - whether that be an architectural, digital or a consumer environment. He is interested in the line between the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional and is in a constant state of experimentation. Images are ubiquitous, and Pollard's work offers a moment of reflection on how we interact with our immediate surroundings - especially the digital. His work borrows vocabulary from painting and sculpture, creating artificially constructed spaces for his photographs to exist in. There is a continuous push and pull between the virtual and the physical.</p>

    <p>Pollard has exhibited work throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, and most recently has shown work with the ZAZ Corner billboard in Times Square, NYC. He has his first solo and international exhibition scheduled for September 2020 at Space Place Gallery in Nizhny Tagil, Russia. </p>
