    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
		<p>I am fascinated by the Eastern thought "Everything in the universe come from the same root as myself" and "All things and I are of one substance." I ponder birth and passing of life by all creatures in the universe, their coexistence, the infinite cycle of life energy, and ecosystems while applying ink and paint on the paper surface.</p>  
		<p>I paint both representational and abstract paintings; representational in search of natureâ€™s energy, and abstract in search of my inner voice. I dig deep in my mind to find the roots that connect with everything in nature.</p>

		<h2>Biography</h2>

Since moving to San Francisco in 2004, her work has also incorporated elements of American art. Over the years she developed a unique style that is organic and spiritual, based on the philosophies of Zen,  Shinto and Taoism.
