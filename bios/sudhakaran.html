	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>Binuta Sudhakaran is a visual artist living and working in Davis CA. Originally an architect, practicing in India, she moved to Davis to raise her family and has been exploring abstraction on canvas for the past 10 years. Binuta has great reverence for the folk arts and traditional hand- made textiles around the world. After years of working in figurative art and still life, the transition to pure abstraction allowed her to capture the essence and spirit of her subject matter through the medium of pigment glazes on canvas. She enjoys exploring the relationship between color and light on her pieces. In her work you can experience the multitude of colors of India where she grew up and get a sense of the underlying spirituality that guides her in her journey.</p>

	<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
	<p>As an artist, I’m constantly trying to interpret and reinterpret objects and experiences that shape us. My expression of them takes the form of pure abstraction using color and shapes. I’m drawn to geometric patterns, harmony, rhythm and the interplay of light and shade. I use these elements to create a quiet and contemplative space in each piece. I use a very low pigment to medium ratio to create transparent glazes of acrylic paint. This layering process allows light to travel through making color appear deeper while exposing the weave of the canvas beneath. I’m deeply inspired by hand made textiles and fabrics of cultures across the world, especially from South and South east Asia.</p>
