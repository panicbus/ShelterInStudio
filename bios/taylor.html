    <h3>Statement</h3>
    <p>The objects I produce are interrogations. They exist as curious inquiries into the ostensible dichotomy between the human animal and mutating partitions of nature. Using painting as a language, I propose mysterious, abstract narratives which are simultaneously given ground by familiar, objective imagery. Amalgamating scientific, genetic and anthropological source material, I survey and ultimately depict hybrid landscapes where diverse aspects of human physiology mesh with the origins of species. Through the merger of these methods, my exploration into the creative process develops.</p>
