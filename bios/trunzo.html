  	<h2>BIO</h2>
		<p>1979, LT graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a BFA. Shortly after, they left for San Francisco and moved into a live-work storefront. They made art and taught ceramics at clay studios for the next twenty years. In 2000, they returned to painting via classes at SFAI which led to an M.F.A.in 2006.</p>
		<p>They continue to make art and operate a studio in San Francisco with shows at Southern Exposure, David Brower Center, University of North Carolina, Charlotte Street Foundation and many others.</p>
		<p>LT's current oil paintings are larger than life, exaggerated self portraits (i.e. Selfies). They queer themselves into self portraits of famous dead male artists. The surface of the paint opposes the omnipresent flatscreen that has overtaken our lives. Juicy images with color and thick strokes evoke crevices of time and wrinkles, while red lips and a mustache exaggerate masculine and feminine gestures hoping to entice questions of gender.</p>
