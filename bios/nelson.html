    <p>A collector of things, Kara Nelson attempts to use what she finds in order to create artworks. Often, this involves repurposing her own trash as a material for creation. Her work explores themes of stress, lore, craft legacy, and historical and present witchhood. The results are time base sculptures, crafted objects, mixed media installations, and digital projects. Kara lives and works in Oakland, California. She holds a Bachelor of Fine Artfrom California College of the Arts (2008) with an emphasis in painting and drawing and is currently pursuing a Master of Fine Arts degree in the Studio Art program at Mills College. Kara embraces her work being shown in traditional gallery spaces, as well as alternative venues, and select digital spaces.</p>
