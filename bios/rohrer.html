  	<p>Judith Rohrer has lived in the Bay Area most of her life. Her love of art began during a year-long trip throughout Europe and N. Africa following her first year of undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley. Upon her return she majored in Art and went on to receive an M.A. in Art (Painting and Art History) from San Francisco State University.</p> 
  	<p>Although trained in representational modes, she developed an appreciation for Abstract Expressionism. Her love of color motivates her workâ€” color as it interacts with either forms and textures or is spontaneously rendered on the paper. Color evokes moods and emotions and as Judith states, "Color helps me connect with deeper places within myself. It helps me move through stuck places in my psyche and discover a sense of joy within."</p> 
  	<p>Art, for Judith, is also a way to play and have fun! It provides a great balance to her career as a psychotherapist. She uses acrylics, hand-made and found papers, colored pencils and fabric to create her collages. She is currently a juried member of ACCI Gallery in Berkeley and Valley Art Gallery in Walnut Creek and is also represented by ArtfulGalleries.com. She has been in several solo and group shows in the Bay Area.</p>
