  	<p>Jefferson Eisenberg misses the waste basket every time. There's not a single scrap of balled up paper that he's ever put through the hoop. Period! He's a professional schlepper by day, gets very excited when he gets to make a trip to the dump, and on weekends he likes to move many heavy rocks all around his yard for no apparent purpose. </p>

  	<p>He received his MFA in painting from SFAI in 2005 and moved to Sacramento from SF with his partner, Jennifer Jett, in 2015. When he's not schlepping heavy things, going to the dump or making art, he co-runs TGTG with fellow artist Jen Merrill.</p>
