  	<p>I'm fascinated by all that I see in the natural world. My passion for portraying that beauty is the force behind my paintings. The fleeting drama of weather and atmosphere creates an unending joyful challenge.</p>

		<p>I paint to celebrate the qualities of shifting light, long vistas of space that evoke possibility and freedom, and the brilliant tranquility of light on water. I love the cool clarity and luminosity of northern California and it's mysterious transformative fog.</p>

		<p>I enjoy studying and painting the layered complexities of visual phenomena, like rocks submerged in water, seen through a surface reflection of the sky, and abstracted by ripples or wind.</p>

		<p>It's also exciting to explore and paint the personalities of different geographical areas, and capture remnants of California's history and culture, it's coastal villages, small family farms and ranches.</p>

		<p>I hope that viewing my paintings will bring pleasure and inspiration to others.</p>
