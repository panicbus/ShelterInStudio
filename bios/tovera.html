    <p>Tobias Tovera is an American visual artist whose work explores the intersection of nature, art, andconsciousness. Tovera was born in Sacramento, California and studied at the California College of the Artsand the San Francisco Art Institute. His work has been exhibited in solo and group shows in the United States and Europe, and is part of numerous private, public, and corporate collections. Using the concept oftime as a foundation, Tovera's studio practice seeks to reveal energy systems, finding new dimensions inhis materials as they metamorphose from one form to the next. The conception of his work was inspiredby alchemy, medicine, and the primordial formations of living matter. From the chemistry of water reactingwith minerals to a magic that reaches beyond science, Tovera's work examines opposing elements such asnature and artifice, chaos and order, to reveal how they interact, transform, or propel each other.</p>

    <p>Tovera states, "I want my art to spark connection with nature and through process and alchemy, create a visualform that liberates both an intimate as well as an unknown aspect of the cosmos." During the course of his career Tovera has developed two bodies of work in painting and a series of sculptures. His new work investigates the interplay between his paintings and his sculptures and how they inform each other.</p>

  	<p>Tobias lives and works in Brooklyn, New York and Oakland, California and is the founder of the Ark Project, aninternational artist residency program. He has been awarded with residencies at the Performance ArtInstitute, Root Division, and Local Language Art and has been published in American Artwork, Studio Journal Knock, and Art Voices Magazine.</p>
